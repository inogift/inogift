Patrick smells a rat and uses the guard dog to find a nearby second corpse, Valerie Brestin, similarly clobbered, financial director at Donald Beechum's firm Agile Turtle and volunteer at Donovan Treadlow's homeless shelter out of guilt after fatally hitting a vagrant by car. Patrick doubts profiler Montague's theory that this MO points to the ten years inactive serial killer Caveman, which a macabre package makes likely again, but Patrick proves the victims have a link, a bus line where they could be picked, with a criminal driver.

The local police suspects Ron Crosswhite, whom she interviewed the previous evening and probably got away with shooting his wife, city clerk Ginger (31), because officer Tom Rowley clumsily ruined the crucial video recording. While grudgingly reporting to pay a traffic fine, Jane is taken hostage by Crowley with other people in city hall to demand immunity and his wife's real killer being found. After the CBI director, politically influenced by Bagshaw, first gives the case to police chief Arnold Nail and then returns it go Lisbon, Rowley tries to shoot Crowley but only wounds another hostage. Jane gets Crowley to see sense and sets a trap for the double murderer.

His daughter Trina probably has crucial memories, but aunt Jody, a retired army nurse, shields her most hostile against Patrick. He helps the team overcome that and Essex's accomplice Eugene Boden's alibi. LaRoche was planning to grill Van Pelt in the arson investigation anyway. FBI agent Craig supports her and successfully proposes.

He was meeting a buyer for a Mayan golden pendant, the only item stolen there. His transport crew is caught, also dealing in illegal arms, but Patrick believes the motive personal. Laroche's IA investigation reduced serial cop-killer Todd Johnson's torch-murder suspects to five CBI members with opportunity, including only one with a motive: agent Madeleine Hightower was the former lover of murdered CHip Jim Rance. Links between both cases are found. Patrick however sees it all as part of Red John's master plan.

Lisbon's rudeness to LaRoche before the announcement he succeeds Hightower at the team's supervisor leads to her being replaced by Cho, who instantly does a fine job. Mycah got death threats as head of the transplant unit, making suspects of his successor, the surgery chief, and those denied priority for life-saving organs. Patrick works out the mystery of Micah's radiation badge being exposed badly, unlike his body, leading to expose a serious theft and the special status of patient Siberia, a Russian mob baron with an unconditionally devoted bodyguard.

Adulterorus clients probably feared exposure of affairs with him, colleague Mike Vilanueva lost clients to Markus and he recently repaid a loan-shark. Patrick, found not guilty in court, is reinstated as CBI consultant and assigned to the team of senior agent Ray Haffner, who handles the case and recruits Cho to read Jane. Lisbon remains suspended pending a full investigation, but the old team conspires under Patrick to solve the Kuzmenko case on their own. Jane stirs trouble among Ray's own team and sets traps for him and the murderer. Tim's widow commits suicide, leaving a note she couldn't live without her Red John, but the real one's lover doesn't recognize his corpse.

Beth refuses to believe Jane that paranormal gifts are fake, so she pushes him to collaborate with her present 'spiritual adviser', Nate Glass. Apart from Nathan, the team looks for suspects in the family, including Beth's present partner Deke Hutton and Conner's step-brother Jonathan Flint. Prime suspect on account of the MO is yet unidentified serial killer 'Balloon Man', so called after his lure, but he strangulates within 12 hours.

A local photographer is found fatally short during the mayor's political rally. Jane however largely leaves that case to Lisbon, focusing on a bystander he singes out on sight as potential murderer. It's unemployed gun-obsessed Texan insurance investigator Henry Tibbs, who fits the psychopath profile, but hasn't committed any actual crimes. Patrick 'uses' Cho and Rigsby to set a trap, even manipulates Wainwright, who wants to arrest him for gun possession and see him in forced therapy.

So he scrutinizes the closed society islanders, such as fishery entrepreneur Jack LaFleur, butterfly reserve manager William Gardner and Jed Stack's ranch, focusing on mainland connections. Meanwhile the team starts from the victim's past as a wayward foster-kid who wanted to revenge her father, whose murderer may have an islander alias. And Rigsby faces his date in her capacity as rather hostile public defender.

Gabriel senior is in the final stage of terminal cancer, so adolescent son Sergio Porchetto becomes his heir. Security chief Curtis Nett is remarkably uncooperative. Junior compromised the gang's business by challenging Luis Ozorio's Mexican drug cartel, the Zetas. Patrick tricks Senior and his boys to stage a trap.

Patrick expected correctly special agent Susan Darcy only wants to grill him again about the false Red John. Luckily for the first suspect, a veteran, who 'confesses' probably having killed her during a blackout, Patrick looks on.

A clue in the alley leads Jane to dressing room of the drag queens where he meets Glennda Snow who is the "Queen Mother" of the ensemble. She admits to being in the alley shortly before the murder but the other drag queens say she was back in the dressing room before the time of the murder. Although she is cleared of involvement in the murder, Jane still suspects she knows more than she is admitting. The CBI team end up relying on Glennda as a material witness when trying to determine which of their three suspects is guilty. Just when you think the case has been successfully wrapped up, Jane reveals a surprise twist that sheds a whole new light on the events that transpired in the alley the night of the murder.

Meanwhile he solves the murder of Antonio Castro, who suffocated naked and conscious inside a coffin buried in a ruin. He was a derivatives broker in Dennis Victor's firm, where embezzlement took place. Suspects include a colleague and their supervisor, also members of an exclusive club, which was hazing Castro.
