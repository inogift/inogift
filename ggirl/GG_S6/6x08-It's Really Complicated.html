<h1 class="full-script"> 6x04 - Portrait of a Lady Alexander </h1>





<p class="full-script">Gossip girl here-- your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.</p>
<p class="full-script">I made a deal to sell some oil from the Sudan.</p>
<p class="full-script">There was an embargo in place, which made it illegal.</p>
<p class="full-script">Was anyone hurt? - No.</p>
<p class="full-script">She said Bart walked in with an envelope.</p>
<p class="full-script">And he's not about to show you what's in the envelope.</p>
<p class="full-script">He won't, but someone else might--Bruce Caplan.</p>
<p class="full-script">The Bass business manager? I'm not gonna let you threaten our family ever again.</p>
<p class="full-script">Don't! You are indebted to me, and I'm here to collect.</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck, it was all my fault.</p>
<p class="full-script">He cornered me.</p>
<p class="full-script">My father? Are you sure that I'm the one person you wanna be with? You have always been the one.</p>
<p class="full-script">Humphrey, where the hell have you been? I'm writing the Serena chapter.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, even if we can't put Bart behind bars, we'll still be together.</p>
<p class="full-script">We made a pact.</p>
<p class="full-script">We can't be together.</p>
<p class="full-script">Gobble, gobble, upper east siders.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's right.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's Thanksgiving again.</p>
<p class="full-script">And I hope you all brought your appetites, because today's the one day a year you're supposed to count your blessings I love the parade.</p>
<p class="full-script">And not your calories.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't care whether you're sick to your stomach or simply on a liquid diet.</p>
<p class="full-script">This turkey day, I'm going to make sure everyone eats their hearts out.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dorota, did you remember my noise-canceling headphones and my Bottega eye mask? Flying alone on the holidays is like Chatroulette.</p>
<p class="full-script">So why go to Paris? We both know today is most favorite day of year.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ah, yes, it is true.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thanksgiving does hold a special place in my heart-- and stomach-- but I guess this year a pumpkin macaroon will just have to do.</p>
<p class="full-script">But every Thanksgiving, you try to visit Miss Eleanor.</p>
<p class="full-script">And this year, I'm actually going to make it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Besides, we both know that if I stay in town, I'll just be meddling in other people's affairs, and I promised myself I would not do that this year.</p>
<p class="full-script">Still no word from Mr .</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck since pop-up show? No, and I'm not going to call him either.</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck only goes darker when I push him, so I'm gonna give him all the time and space he needs.</p>
<p class="full-script">He'll snap out of his funk eventually.</p>
<p class="full-script">And you okay leaving Miss Serena alone with Mr.</p>
<p class="full-script">Lonely Boy? Well, I don't want her back with that backstabbing Brooklynite, but now that we're best friends again, I have to just hold my tongue and let this ridiculous relationship run its course.</p>
<p class="full-script">Like stomach flow.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, and until then, I will just play the supportive friend, which we both know I'm much better at from the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now vite, vite.</p>
<p class="full-script">Sweet potato casserole with marshmallows and pecans! Yum! How that's a side dish and not a dessert, I will never know.</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena, you have to see this new hotel in Turks and Caicos.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bart and I are gonna practically be sleeping on the beach tonight.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're not gonna be here for Thanksgiving? Well, after everything we went through with Charles' vendetta, Bart thought we could use a little R&amp;R on Malcolm Beach.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now I just need to find out where Laryssa stored my Missonis for the winter.</p>
<p class="full-script">Try Eric's closet.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, this might actually be a good thing.</p>
<p class="full-script">It'll just be the two of us.</p>
<p class="full-script">or maybe we can invite everyone? We can invite Rufus, and since Bart's not here, we can invite Chuck and then Nate and then Blair.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't know.</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, it's our first Thanksgiving back together, and--and given our track record with Thanksgivings, it might be kinda risky.</p>
<p class="full-script">Divorces have been filed, affairs revealed.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, but that was our parents, not us.</p>
<p class="full-script">Come on.</p>
<p class="full-script">They're not even gonna be here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay.</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, if it's what you really want, I'm in.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">All right, so I'll go invite my dad and grab the world-famous Humphrey stuffing recipe.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, well, I'll stop by Blair's, and then I'll go to the market and try to upgrade for a bigger bird.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay.</p>
<p class="full-script">Back here in a couple hours? Perfect.</p>
<p class="full-script">Where's monkey? I found his crying at my door comforting.</p>
<p class="full-script">I had him from housekeeping take him for a walk.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why? Because you were too busy reading up on new ways to betray your best friend? Chuck, you know how sorry I am.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bart's threatening to send me to prison for cooking &quot;The Spectator's&quot; books.</p>
<p class="full-script">And I don't want to hurt you again, so I've been going over these documents, just trying to figure a way out of this whole mess.</p>
<p class="full-script">Good luck with that.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bart Bass is a grand master of manipulation.</p>
<p class="full-script">He has ruined me.</p>
<p class="full-script">You'll be child's play.</p>
<p class="full-script">My advice is to lie back and think of England.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, thanks for the help.</p>
<p class="full-script">If I could defeat my father, do you think I'd be here drinking alone, unable to be with the woman I love? Maybe you should do some research into finding yourself a hot tub time machine so you can go back and undo your creative accounting.</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm so glad you're still here.</p>
<p class="full-script">So my thanksgiving plans changed.</p>
<p class="full-script">Let me guess.</p>
<p class="full-script">Humphrey left you high and dry.</p>
<p class="full-script">Not to worry.</p>
<p class="full-script">I still have a free first class companion ticket to Paris for anyone other than Dorota.</p>
<p class="full-script">What? It is not my fault that Vanya took the kids to Minsk.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, Dan and I are great.</p>
<p class="full-script">Actually, we decided to host thanksgiving together, and I need you there.</p>
<p class="full-script">Miss Blair, Miss Eleanor is expecting you.</p>
<p class="full-script">You made promise to her and to self.</p>
<p class="full-script">Please, Blair, We really wanna spend thanksgiving with you, and I'm not gonna take no for answer.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay.</p>
<p class="full-script">If that's what you really want, Then I, as your friend, will be there to make sure things run the way they should.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yay! Okay,I already texted Nate.</p>
<p class="full-script">Can you let Chuck know for me? Miss Blair giving Mr.</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck space.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now that Paris is canceled, everything is changed.</p>
<p class="full-script">Amazing.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, I'm gonna go to Pellegrini's, and I'll see you soon.</p>
<p class="full-script">What happened to no meddling this year?! Did you hear her? She is getting domestic with that wool-haired whiner.</p>
<p class="full-script">Four major holidays stand between thanksgiving and Serena being a June bride.</p>
<p class="full-script">Measures must be taken-- drastic measures.</p>
<p class="full-script">Good to see you.</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you want, Blair? Nothing.</p>
<p class="full-script">Just to help those less fortunate, like I do every thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="full-script">Unless, of course, you're no longer interested in Nate.</p>
<p class="full-script">I am, but I'm not moronic enough to trust you to help me get him.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's too bad because I think Serena and Dan's thanksgiving would be the perfect opportunity for you to reconnect.</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena would never invite me.</p>
<p class="full-script">She's not exactly thankful I screened her s*x tape for all of New York society.</p>
<p class="full-script">You make a point, but Nate will never forgive you unless you undo the damage between S and your father.</p>
<p class="full-script">Except that I don't want them together.</p>
<p class="full-script">You said yourself that he's miserable without her.</p>
<p class="full-script">And besides, she's Serena van der Woodsen.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's a man.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's probably gonna go back to her anyway.</p>
<p class="full-script">So this just at least gives you the chance to date Nate Archibald.</p>
<p class="full-script">Fine.</p>
<p class="full-script">Tell me what to do.</p>
<p class="full-script">Further instructions will come forth from my avatar--Dorota.</p>
<p class="full-script">Shoo.</p>
<p class="full-script">Go.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's good.</p>
<p class="full-script">Go ahead.</p>
<p class="full-script">Georgina.</p>
<p class="full-script">How's Philip? Quit the small talk, Humphrey.</p>
<p class="full-script">Give me the pages.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's gonna be tough since I already messengered the only hard copy to Graydon's assistant at home.</p>
<p class="full-script">What? No one wants to read your vomit draft.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why didn't you let me give you my notes first? Because you're not my editor.</p>
<p class="full-script">I am your everything.</p>
<p class="full-script">Don't you think I know exactly what's going on here? You started this chapter over the summer, skewering Serena, and then you moved in with her and you decided to write a sniveling Valentine in hopes she would fall madly in love with you.</p>
<p class="full-script">From the beginning, my goal with this book was to tell the truth, and I haven't strayed from that.</p>
<p class="full-script">So I'm sorry if you're upset, but you're just gonna have to wait for the chapter to go online tonight.</p>
<p class="full-script">Philip, get me the home address of Graydon Carter's assistant.</p>
<p class="full-script">I was just thinking about you.</p>
<p class="full-script">You were? I'm still grocery shopping.</p>
<p class="full-script">I think I may have overdone it a little.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who doesn't love leftovers? I'm guessing that means everybody's in.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, they are.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, my god! Serena! Hey! Let me call you back.</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hi.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hi.</p>
<p class="full-script">Seeing you is the first thing I've been thankful for in weeks.</p>
<p class="full-script">I owe you an apology.</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck.</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck, wake up.</p>
<p class="full-script">Seriously, Chuck, wake up.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bruce Caplan is dead.</p>
<p class="full-script">The guy was a two-bit crook.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who cares? You should.</p>
<p class="full-script">I just got off the phone with his secretary.</p>
<p class="full-script">Apparently, Bruce died only a few days after our last meeting.</p>
<p class="full-script">He fell off the Bass Enterprises yacht.</p>
<p class="full-script">Is there a point to this sob story? Your father probably figured out that it was Bruce who tipped us off to the microfilm in the painting.</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you honestly think that Bart had nothing to do with his death? Even if he did, I promise you he covered his tracks or destroyed the evidence or had Lily do it for him.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now get out of my room.</p>
<p class="full-script">Seems like Bass is basking in his misery.</p>
<p class="full-script">Looks like I'm not the only one who goes into hiding on thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="full-script">Step aside.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you deaf? I said move it, buster! I'm sorry, Ms.</p>
<p class="full-script">Waldorf, but Mr.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bass gave us specific instructions.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're no longer welcome at the Empire.</p>
<p class="full-script">And this year's best dish is going to be served by yours truly.</p>
<p class="full-script">So how's life been treating you since I treated you so badly? Better than I thought, honestly.</p>
<p class="full-script">What about you? I'm good.</p>
<p class="full-script">I just got back from Uganda.</p>
<p class="full-script">We're supplying vitamins to all the hospitals there and He's been terrible.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's embarrassing, but maybe a-a little true.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">We all know I have a knack for humiliating people.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, excuse me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Van der Woodsen.</p>
<p class="full-script">Spence.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm--I'm really sorry about cotillion, too.</p>
<p class="full-script">I kind of freaked out when I thought my dad loved you more than he loved me, but I realize now he loved us both.</p>
<p class="full-script">And this just keeps getting more uncomfortable by the minute.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, I think that night was weird for all of us, but I'm glad that we have the holidays to have a fresh start.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Wow.</p>
<p class="full-script">Looks like you got the last one.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thanks.</p>
<p class="full-script">Wow.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are we really so pathetic that we're having a chicken on Thanksgiving? We were supposed to be in Amsterdam, but someone didn't finish her college applications.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know, but doesn't that look so delicious? It's a raw turkey.</p>
<p class="full-script">It looks disgusting, actually.</p>
<p class="full-script">Um, but you know what? Nobody should spend Thanksgiving eating chicken alone.</p>
<p class="full-script">So--so why don't you two join us for dinner? I mean, I-I think we can spare some turkey.</p>
<p class="full-script">And--and the Van der Woodsens do have a long history of inviting bump-ins.</p>
<p class="full-script">What the hell took you so long? And good morning to you, too, Blair.</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck banned me from the Empire? I mean, he's banished me before, but that was when we were on a s*x fast.</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you want me to say? Chuck has hit bottom.</p>
<p class="full-script">All he does now is drink in bed and argue with monkey.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, I had no idea it was that bad.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, it's bad.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's even giving up on defeating Bart.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, that can't happen.</p>
<p class="full-script">We can't let Bart win.</p>
<p class="full-script">We have to reinspire him.</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you think I've been trying to do? Chuck didn't even care when I told him that Bruce Caplan mysteriously drowned.</p>
<p class="full-script">His dentist? No, that's Brad Caplan.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bruce is the Bass business manager who apparently fell off Bart's yacht.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's not a coincidence that one of the only people who knew about Bart's illegal oil trading died in a freak accident.</p>
<p class="full-script">Especially since Sheikh Hassan, the man who sold Bart the oil, died in an accident, too.</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, maybe if we can connect the two, we can take that to the authorities.</p>
<p class="full-script">Or at least get Lily to see who Bart really is.</p>
<p class="full-script">I have an idea.</p>
<p class="full-script">All I need is a wampum pouch, a push-up bra, and all of Bart's computer passwords.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan! Happy Thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="full-script">You, too.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dusting off the old 6-string.</p>
<p class="full-script">I like it.</p>
<p class="full-script">As a matter of fact, I'm on my way out to a benefit concert Lisa's throwing at the bandshell.</p>
<p class="full-script">You should come with.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's a hormone-free potluck.</p>
<p class="full-script">That sounds tempting, but I'm here to invite you to a Lily-free dinner that Serena and I are hosting at the Van der Woodsens'.</p>
<p class="full-script">Jenny told me you two were back together last time we skyped.</p>
<p class="full-script">You can say it.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know you disapprove.</p>
<p class="full-script">I guess I'm just surprised you haven't learned by now.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, learned--learned what? That we Humphrey men don't stand a real chance when it comes to Van der Woodsen women.</p>
<p class="full-script">Is this the speech where you tell me that we're from different worlds? Because, you know, I-I did--I wrote the book.</p>
<p class="full-script">Two, actually.</p>
<p class="full-script">Women like Lily and Serena are never gonna respect guys like us.</p>
<p class="full-script">All the love songs I wrote Lily made no difference.</p>
<p class="full-script">Poetry isn't what she wants.</p>
<p class="full-script">No matter how much we love Lily and Serena, they're always gonna choose guys like Bart Bass.</p>
<p class="full-script">So maybe the trick is to become Bart Bass.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, but neither of us could ever do that.</p>
<p class="full-script">And that's a good thing.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bart's cold and calculating.</p>
<p class="full-script">A reptile.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, well, that snake is spending Thanksgiving with Lily, and you're not.</p>
<p class="full-script">I should go.</p>
<p class="full-script">Daphne, right? Graydon's assistant at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;? Georgina Sparks.</p>
<p class="full-script">We've spoken on the phone ad nauseam.</p>
<p class="full-script">I just got off the phone with Dan Humphrey.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm done working on Thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="full-script">Daphne, I, of all people, understand the challenge facing a young mother in the big city.</p>
<p class="full-script">I, too, have a little rug rat, and it is a constant struggle to balance family and career.</p>
<p class="full-script">So, please, mother to mother, I need to see a copy of Dan's Serena chapter.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know that I'm not allowed to give out copies of writer's submissions.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now if you don't mind Oh.</p>
<p class="full-script">But I do mind.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why don't you make it easy on yourself and your little bed-wetter and just give me a sneak peek? No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ask Dan if you wanna read his Serena chapters.</p>
<p class="full-script">Chapters? There's more than one? I thought we were done, but he just sent me something else.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did somebody order a Thanksgiving spread? You just cost my dim-witted doorman his holiday bonus.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ohh.</p>
<p class="full-script">Don't blame him.</p>
<p class="full-script">I said you called for a stripper, and obviously I'm a convincing one.</p>
<p class="full-script">I've come to kidnap you and bring you to Serena and Dan's Thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not going anywhere, but you are, unless you want me to call security.</p>
<p class="full-script">Don't be a grumpy gus.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bart and Lily won't be there.</p>
<p class="full-script">Come on.</p>
<p class="full-script">Let's get you cleaned up.</p>
<p class="full-script">What part of our last conversation did you not understand? As long as I can't defeat my father, we can never be together.</p>
<p class="full-script">Just because we can't live happily ever after doesn't mean that we can't have a little fun once in a while.</p>
<p class="full-script">We made a pact.</p>
<p class="full-script">Need I remind you what that means? But it's been too long since Monaco.</p>
<p class="full-script">Pocahontas needs her John Smith.</p>
<p class="full-script">I always thought of myself as more of a John Rolfe kind of man.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's my Chuck.</p>
<p class="full-script">You can play both after dinner.</p>
<p class="full-script">And you're sure Lily and Bart are gone? They are, and now so is my appetite.</p>
<p class="full-script">When was the last time you showered? Only if you join me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Something smells divine.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, that would be Dorota's candied yams.</p>
<p class="full-script">Aren't you two supposed to be on a white sand beach where no one pays capital gains tax? Tropical storm.</p>
<p class="full-script">Our flight was delayed.</p>
<p class="full-script">So it looks like we'll be staying for dinner after all, if we're not imposing.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, no.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, not at all.</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, we have plenty of food.</p>
<p class="full-script">We'll just We're gonna need to change up the seating arrangements.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mom, you're here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, we got rained out.</p>
<p class="full-script">Darling, you went grocery shopping.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm so proud.</p>
<p class="full-script">Looks like we're gonna need to set two more places.</p>
<p class="full-script">Um, actually, make that four.</p>
<p class="full-script">Look who I ran into at the grocery store.</p>
<p class="full-script">Blair's plan worked perfectly.</p>
<p class="full-script">Eh.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh.</p>
<p class="full-script">How are you? Mmm.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yum.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why are you mad? I didn't decide to close the airport.</p>
<p class="full-script">Lily and Bart are the least of my concerns.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, you're mad that I invited Steven to dinner.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, no, I'm thrilled that you invited your ex to our Thanksgiving dinner.</p>
<p class="full-script">I was hoping maybe Ben or Colin or Carter could stop by later for apple crostata.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, come on, Dan.</p>
<p class="full-script">I only invited them because they had nowhere else to go.</p>
<p class="full-script">What would you have done? Called you, given you a heads-up.</p>
<p class="full-script">In an equal partnership, you're supposed to take the other person's feelings into consideration.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">But it just-- it happened so quickly.</p>
<p class="full-script">And honestly, I didn't think you'd care.</p>
<p class="full-script">That you invited the guy you were ready to get engaged to at cotillion? Why are you being so insecure? Look I'm fine that your ex is here.</p>
<p class="full-script">'cause you invited her.</p>
<p class="full-script">But we're together now.</p>
<p class="full-script">I think your stuffing's burning.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm so glad you two could make it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, everything looks wonderful.</p>
<p class="full-script">Doesn't everything look wonderful? The bar certainly does.</p>
<p class="full-script">He'll perk up.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's just dehydrated.</p>
<p class="full-script">And is that your old beau looking more handsome than ever? It's so generous of you and Dan to invite him to your thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not sure Dan feels the same way.</p>
<p class="full-script">What are they Tropical storm.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hopefully Chuck can hold his tongue until after the pie? Have you seen Nate? No, not yet.</p>
<p class="full-script">Charles? Lily.</p>
<p class="full-script">What are you doing here? I live here, and I'm hoping that your presence today means that you're going to apologize to your father and put this feud behind you.</p>
<p class="full-script">The problem with putting Bart behind me is that then he can stab me in the back.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who invited him? Well, it is Thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="full-script">Let's try to have a nice meal together.</p>
<p class="full-script">I think now Charles has no evidence against you, so he can't hurt you anymore.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'd like to make sure of that.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know I'm the last person you expected to see today, but my dad and I ran into serena at the grocery store.</p>
<p class="full-script">And she couldn't help but adopt a couple of strays for Thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="full-script">Pretty much.</p>
<p class="full-script">So can we talk? Don't worry.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not pregnant.</p>
<p class="full-script">I just miss you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Sage, look, now isn't-- Nathaniel.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know what? On second thought, right now is a great time.</p>
<p class="full-script">We'll go upstairs.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan, right? Steven.</p>
<p class="full-script">I hope there's more than one place card for &quot;Serena's ex.</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot; Uh, y-you know what? I'm actually not Serena's ex anymore.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're kidding? No, no, no.</p>
<p class="full-script">This is--this is our Thanksgiving dinner together.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, enjoy it, because I have a feeling it'll be your last.</p>
<p class="full-script">What? Do you need me to spell it out for you? The s*x tape blew up, I broke up with her, and then she ran to you because she's terrified to be alone.</p>
<p class="full-script">Y-you don't know anything about Serena.</p>
<p class="full-script">Or I-I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you still think her name is Sabrina? I know that she needs someone to take care of her, and I know you can't.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, yeah, but you and your Omega-3 empire can? Well, I did all summer, and we were great together.</p>
<p class="full-script">I think we still could be.</p>
<p class="full-script">Happy Thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="full-script">Masterful work, Dorota.</p>
<p class="full-script">If things continue to progress at this rate, Humphrey will be gone by tomorrow.</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck, where are you going? If you think tricking me into making up with my father is going to allow us to be together, you're mistaken.</p>
<p class="full-script">I have to defeat him.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bruce Caplan and the Sheikh are both dead.</p>
<p class="full-script">That--that can't be a coincidence.</p>
<p class="full-script">I have a plan.</p>
<p class="full-script">How many times do I have to tell you Bart is not stupid enough to leave any evidence? We don't need a smoking gun.</p>
<p class="full-script">We just need a single thread to tie the two deaths together.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bruce Caplan was on your father's yacht.</p>
<p class="full-script">And--and maybe the Sheikh was on his way to see Bart.</p>
<p class="full-script">Or maybe Bart had sent the car.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, that kind of information could be hiding in the open.</p>
<p class="full-script">A leasing agreement, a logbook.</p>
<p class="full-script">But the--the FBI aren't gonna take a circumstantial theory.</p>
<p class="full-script">The only person we need to convince that Bart is a murderer is Lily.</p>
<p class="full-script">And Lily's been by his side at every turn.</p>
<p class="full-script">Lily could care less about an oil embargo or a faked death.</p>
<p class="full-script">But a real one? Or two? If only we could get onto the Bass industries server But we need a password.</p>
<p class="full-script">And if only I had texted your uncle Jack to do a little bribing and blackmailing to get them.</p>
<p class="full-script">And if only Nate was upstairs right now, trying them all.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're amazing.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now go see if he's found anything.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, Dominick dummy.</p>
<p class="full-script">Georgina.</p>
<p class="full-script">No van der woodsen family holiday would be complete without you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Keep your flattery in your pants.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know you sent in two Serena chapters to &quot;Vanity fair.&quot; </p>
<p class="full-script">I did.</p>
<p class="full-script">They're both the truth, And I'm still not showing you either.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't need to read them.</p>
<p class="full-script">Obviously one is the stupid Serena serenade that you've been composing since ninth grade, And the other is the piercing expose that you started to write over the summer.</p>
<p class="full-script">Don't be an idiot.</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you wanna win, or do you just wanna win Serena? Serena? Dinner's ready.</p>
<p class="full-script">There is no winning without Serena.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dinner's ready.</p>
<p class="full-script">Daphne, it's Dan.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hi.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, yeah, I've decided which chapter I wanna publish.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, Dorota, this looks amazing.</p>
<p class="full-script">I may need to have a second plate! Oh! And the toasted almonds are such a lovely surprise.</p>
<p class="full-script">Speaking of surprises, I was so sorry to hear about Bruce Caplan's passing.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, w--I had no idea.</p>
<p class="full-script">What happened? He was so young.</p>
<p class="full-script">Drowning.</p>
<p class="full-script">He was sailing on the Bass yacht and just fell overboard in broad daylight.</p>
<p class="full-script">You'd think someone would've jumped in to save him.</p>
<p class="full-script">My god.</p>
<p class="full-script">How tragic for his family.</p>
<p class="full-script">And for Bruce.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's odd that Bart never mentioned it.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, I-I wanted to thank you again for inviting us.</p>
<p class="full-script">It--it means a lot to Sage and to me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, of course.</p>
<p class="full-script">I-I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">I feel terrible though.</p>
<p class="full-script">Up you have enough to eat.</p>
<p class="full-script">I forgot you're gluten-free.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll be fine.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, I-I-I'm more concerned about you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why? I eat everything.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, I-I'm talking about you getting back together with Dan.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, I-I know I hurt you, but I mean, this kinda represents everything you said you were trying to escape from.</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, he wrote all those horrible articles about you and your friends.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, but he didn't write one about me.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know that Dan has made his mistakes, but so have I.</p>
<p class="full-script">Me, too.</p>
<p class="full-script">The biggest being pushing you away.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm still in love with you, Serena.</p>
<p class="full-script">We deserve another chance.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm sorry, but I'm in love with Dan.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're not.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's your rebound from me.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, you were my rebound from him.</p>
<p class="full-script">I left the city Because I thought he wanted to be with Blair.</p>
<p class="full-script">But Dan is my first love.</p>
<p class="full-script">He'll always be.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, maybe I got it right at cotillion after all.</p>
<p class="full-script">Steven Nate, I came up here to make out, not to watch you and Chuck play wikileaks.</p>
<p class="full-script">This isn't gonna work.</p>
<p class="full-script">It has to be at least nine characters.</p>
<p class="full-script">Try this.</p>
<p class="full-script">ParkAve740 There's nothing confidential here.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's all just general files.</p>
<p class="full-script">Doesn't matter.</p>
<p class="full-script">Just look for travel and living expenses, leasing agreements, anything overseas.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, just give us a second.</p>
<p class="full-script">Give me 30, and I'll leave you alone.</p>

<p class="full-script"><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p class="full-script">Amuse the young lady, Nathaniel.</p>
<p class="full-script">I've got this.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">Go.</p>
<p class="full-script">Admit you missed me.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's okay.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't care if you watch.</p>
<p class="full-script">She's a keeper, Nate.</p>
<p class="full-script">And, yes, I can attest to the fact that he missed you, everything has really fallen apart for him since you two broke up.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, so I should probably help Chuck.</p>
<p class="full-script">I did something that I'm not too proud of-- Wait.</p>
<p class="full-script">I think I've got something.</p>
<p class="full-script">It isn't line-caught blue marlin, But it doesn't look half-bad.</p>
<p class="full-script">Lily? I just heard about Bruce Caplan.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">Tragic news.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who told you? Speaking of bruce, I heard he drowned like a rock.</p>
<p class="full-script">or at least had them tied to his ankles.</p>
<p class="full-script">Charles, show some respect.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, maybe we should take a moment to remember Bruce, who died falling off your yacht.</p>
<p class="full-script">And Sheikh Hassan, whose Bass industries-provided car burst into flames.</p>
<p class="full-script">I hate it when that happens.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bart, is that true? I have no idea what kind of car he was driving.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, I think Chuck could shed some light on that.</p>
<p class="full-script">Right? Bentley W12, provided by Bass enterprises.</p>
<p class="full-script">The leasing agreement, hot off the press.</p>
<p class="full-script">So what if we provided the Sheikh's cars? We're certainly not responsible for every mechanical malfunction.</p>
<p class="full-script">So it's just a coincidence that the two men who could've sent you to prison happen to die in transportation you so generously provided them? If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna freshen up.</p>
<p class="full-script">If you done with problem number one, problem number two needs meddling.</p>
<p class="full-script">Have you noticed Mr.</p>
<p class="full-script">Steven has left? I'll be right back.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, thank you again for postponing Paris.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did I see Steven leave? Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you know that he tried to get back together with me? Well, you must be in seventh heaven.</p>
<p class="full-script">Deciding to take the evening apart to consider it? B, you know that Dan's the one.</p>
<p class="full-script">I've been holding my tongue because we're finally friends again.</p>
<p class="full-script">And, the only thing I care about is that you are happy and in love.</p>
<p class="full-script">But Dan Humphrey is not the one.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't want to lose our friendship again either, so I'd appreciate it if you didn't say any more.</p>
<p class="full-script">He is a self-promoting hipster weasel who's thrown every one of his friends under the bus, and I'm not going to sit by and wait for him to do it to you, too.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know in your twisted but loving way you're trying to be protective.</p>
<p class="full-script">But you're wrong about Dan.</p>
<p class="full-script">So please just accept him, and this'll be the best Thanksgiving ever.</p>
<p class="full-script">Lily, please.</p>
<p class="full-script">This is just another one of Chuck's games.</p>
<p class="full-script">When I asked you about the oil deal, you promised me that no one got hurt.</p>
<p class="full-script">And no one did.</p>
<p class="full-script">At least not by me.</p>
<p class="full-script">So Bruce and the Sheikh's death were just pure coincidence? Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you questioning me? Maybe I should start.</p>
<p class="full-script">All I did was protect you.</p>
<p class="full-script">By lying to me.</p>
<p class="full-script">I never lied to you.</p>
<p class="full-script">I told you, no one got hurt.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're hurting me right now.</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck is just getting to you, and he won't stop until I make him.</p>
<p class="full-script">I just wanna thank you all for joining us for our first Thanksgiving together as a couple.</p>
<p class="full-script">Even Georgina, who I didn't actually invite.</p>
<p class="full-script">But welcome.</p>
<p class="full-script">So to many more years of love, happiness, and good friends.</p>
<p class="full-script">Cheers.</p>
<p class="full-script">I, too, have something to be grateful for freedom of the press.</p>
<p class="full-script">If you'll all take a look at your phones, you will soon realize that my protege Daniel Humphrey has just released the latest installment of his serial a chapter on our very own Serena.</p>
<p class="full-script">The right chapter, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="full-script">What's she talking about? &quot;Serena Van Der Woodsen-- golden girl falls from grace.</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot; &quot;A faux love story.</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot; &quot;Serena is nothing.</p>
<p class="full-script">She's a golden shell.</p>
<p class="full-script">Give her love, and she'll do anything you want.</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot; Serena, I know you're upset.</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot;With Daddy issues like these, &quot;It's not hard to push the right buttons.</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot;And once you do, &quot;The most powerful girl on the upper east side has no power at all.</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot; I understand if you would've written this in the spring.</p>
<p class="full-script">you were so mad at me then.</p>
<p class="full-script">But why would you write this now? Why--why not write it now? It's no less true than it was then.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">I must be confused.</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, has everything that's happened since cotillion been a lie? The--the vespa? The bar? Did--did you ask someone to stop the elevator? Vanya.</p>
<p class="full-script">I told him I was trying to win you back.</p>
<p class="full-script">But everything I've said about how I feel is the truth.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, that's that's not possible.</p>
<p class="full-script">That doesn't make sense.</p>
<p class="full-script">You couldn't say these things about me if you loved me.</p>
<p class="full-script">I invited you into my home, Dan, and my world, and--and then you just humiliate me.</p>
<p class="full-script">That is the issue.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's &quot;My world&quot; Oh, come on.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's a figure of speech.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, it has always been your world, and you've never let me forget it.</p>
<p class="full-script">I've always been a visitor-- the poor kid from Brooklyn who you've never seen as an equal to you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, so this is your payback? Do you feel better about riding the subway to school since you made a fool of me and everyone? What I did is no worse than what all your friends do to each other every day.</p>
<p class="full-script">You try to ruin each other, and then you sit down for Thanksgiving and you call yourselves family.</p>
<p class="full-script">You were supposed to be different.</p>
<p class="full-script">I used to be.</p>
<p class="full-script">Got me nowhere.</p>
<p class="full-script">So now I'm the same.</p>
<p class="full-script">Good-bye, Dan.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you okay? I don't know.</p>
<p class="full-script">But you can gloat.</p>
<p class="full-script">You were right.</p>
<p class="full-script">For the first time ever, I'm sorry I was.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, 90% sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thanksgiving is ruined once again.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you kidding? What is Thanksgiving without a side of drama? And pie.</p>
<p class="full-script">Apple or pumpkin? Both.</p>
<p class="full-script">Lily.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm fine.</p>
<p class="full-script">I, I just need some fresh air.</p>
<p class="full-script">Maybe you should sit down.</p>
<p class="full-script">I can get you a glass of water.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, Charles, I forgot how sweet you are.</p>
<p class="full-script">The only thing that matters is that you finally know the truth.</p>
<p class="full-script">I do, and I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">What on earth do you have to be sorry for? For believing all of your lies.</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Actually, I was just going to tell Charles how sorry I am for trying to force a reconciliation between the two of you.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know that will never happen, and I should have accepted it sooner.</p>
<p class="full-script">Happy Thanksgiving to you, too, Lily.</p>
<p class="full-script">I promise it'll get better.</p>
<p class="full-script">Nate and I survived both our chapters.</p>
<p class="full-script">It didn't work.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, Dan, before you go That was from all of us.</p>
<p class="full-script">Daniel.</p>
<p class="full-script">I just wanted to say I was impressed with your latest literary offering.</p>
<p class="full-script">You've restored my faith in your generation.</p>
<p class="full-script">If you ever need anything, give a call.</p>
<p class="full-script">Do not leave me alone with them.</p>
<p class="full-script">The last time I attended a shunning, I froze my zhopa off in Siberia.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, it can get just as cold around here.</p>
<p class="full-script">You think they hate me? They fear you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Welcome to the upper east side.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mind if I join you? Not at all.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's been a trying night.</p>
<p class="full-script">I was thinking about taking a few days at Miraval, If you don't mind.</p>
<p class="full-script">Sounds like a perfect idea.</p>
<p class="full-script">What's wrong? Who called? Mm.</p>
<p class="full-script">Nobody.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, we need to work on your poker face.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're not fooling anyone.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mmm.</p>
<p class="full-script">Like Chuck said, it hasn't been a great time for me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay.</p>
<p class="full-script">So? Tell me what's going on.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who was on the phone? Look.</p>
<p class="full-script">It was Bart Bass.</p>
<p class="full-script">A few months ago, I made a mistake with &quot;The spectator&quot; finances.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, the kind that sends you to prison.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bart knows, and he's using it as blackmail to turn me against Chuck.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, there must be some way out of it.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, there isn't, Because I'm guilty.</p>
<p class="full-script">And if you wanna leave now, then I totally understand.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you kidding? Now you're the good guy and the bad boy.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not going anywhere.</p>
<p class="full-script">They kicked you out, didn't they? I saw your piece on Serena.</p>
<p class="full-script">You let me off easy by comparison.</p>
<p class="full-script">All I did was tell the truth.</p>
<p class="full-script">Your truth.</p>
<p class="full-script">Everybody has a version, or way of delivering it.</p>
<p class="full-script">It wouldn't have been my choice.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, maybe that's why Lily doesn't respect you.</p>
<p class="full-script">So is this how you become Bart Bass? I did what I had to do.</p>
<p class="full-script">And tonight, for the first time, they weren't looking down on me.</p>
<p class="full-script">They might've hated me, but I was one of them.</p>
<p class="full-script">Congratulations I guess.</p>
<p class="full-script">So now that you've achieved that, you can come back to Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="full-script">What I want isn't in Brooklyn, dad.</p>
<p class="full-script">I have a plan.</p>
<p class="full-script">I have this whole time and it's working.</p>
<p class="full-script">Lily, I've had all the stepmothering I can handle for one day.</p>
<p class="full-script">Charles, please listen to me.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm a fool for trusting your father all this time.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's what I was trying to apologize to you for before-- Bart interrupted.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm on my way to Miraval for a week, and I'm scared to be around your father, and I fear he's coming after you, too.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm well aware.</p>
<p class="full-script">Unfortunately, I think there is little I can do to stop him.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bruce Caplan and the Sheikh's deaths won't stick in court without hard evidence, and you made s'mores of all the financial records.</p>
<p class="full-script">Not before I carefully read each film with Cece's jewler's loupe.</p>
<p class="full-script">She always said that was the best way to catch a husband in a lie.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know she was referring to low-grade diamonds, but still I'll send you everything I can remember.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's the least I can do.</p>
<p class="full-script">Charles Be safe.</p>
<p class="full-script">Nathaniel, remember when I said would ask for your help in the future? Meet me at my office first thing tomorrow.</p>
<p class="full-script">Unless, of course, you'd rather a wake-up call from the FEDS.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll be there.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thanksgiving may be over, But I hear that our favorite upper east siders are still cooking something up.</p>
<p class="full-script">And pretty soon, everyone is going to feel the heat.</p>
<p class="full-script">Of course, when you fan an old flame, sometimes you wind up just getting burned and having to start from scratch.</p>
<p class="full-script">I just got your text.</p>
<p class="full-script">What happened? Lily has finally seen the light.</p>
<p class="full-script">She's going to help me take down Bart.</p>
<p class="full-script">Will you go to war with me? I thought you'd never ask.</p>
<p class="full-script">Luckily, the things that have been slowly simmering always taste the most satisfying.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bon appetit.</p>
<p class="full-script">X.</p>
<p class="full-script">O.</p>
<p class="full-script">X.</p>
<p class="full-script">O.</p>
