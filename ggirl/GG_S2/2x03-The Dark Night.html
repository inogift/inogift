<p class="full-script">We'll finish your fitting tomorrow.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm--i'm so sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">That was completely, completely unprofessional, And I promise it will never happen again from me.</p>
<p class="full-script">I s--i swear.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know you won't.</p>
<p class="full-script">Not here at least.</p>

<p class="full-script">You think that there's, like, a box that says, &quot;open in event of serena van der woodsen emergency&quot;? I live in the building.</p>
<p class="full-script">that's all.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, it's a citywide blackout, So there--there must be hundreds of people stuck in elevators right now.</p>

<p class="full-script">I am? Yeah.</p>
<p class="full-script">don't let it go to your head.</p>
<p class="full-script">But my mom still thinks chuck's lending us the money, So just sending it through me.</p>
<p class="full-script">So borrowing money from your son's friend is fine, But whoring him out to pay the club bill isn't.</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you wanna be with this woman? No, I want to be with you.</p>
<p class="full-script">But I just know that's not gonna happen now, so Nate You have to end this for yourself.</p>

<p class="full-script">I need you to make me feel alive.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh uh, wait, wait.</p>
<p class="full-script">What are you-- what are you talking about? Just meet me up in my bedroom, okay? Looks like lady b.</p>
<p class="full-script">is determined to have it all.</p>
<p class="full-script">Question is, who with? Nate? Actually, I was looking for him myself.</p>
<p class="full-script">Vanessa, is it? Oh, I see.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're thinking, Look at this awful woman who's taking advantage of an innocent young boy.</p>
<p class="full-script">Nate told me everything.</p>
<p class="full-script">I think what you're doing is disgusting.</p>
<p class="full-script">And yet you're here, waiting for him, willing to forgive and forget.</p>
<p class="full-script">You must really care for him.</p>
<p class="full-script">You wouldn't understand.</p>
<p class="full-script">See, that's where you're wrong.</p>
<p class="full-script">You have no idea how I feel about nate and what I would do to keep him.</p>
<p class="full-script">You want me to tell you? Marcus, is that you? Blow out your candle.</p>
<p class="full-script">I spent the last month going around and meeting with The--the stores and the boutiques that carry my clothes.</p>
<p class="full-script">That must have been so exciting.</p>
<p class="full-script">I felt like a fat cheerleader.</p>
<p class="full-script">As a designer, your worst fear is becoming irrelevant.</p>
<p class="full-script">Then I come back here and find out the Teenage intern tells me that exact thing.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm really sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">Maybe that is exactly what I needed to hear.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, the first real dress I ever bought was one of yours.</p>
<p class="full-script">Just spare me the pity.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's true.</p>
<p class="full-script">I bought it from--well, from a consignment store ah.</p>
<p class="full-script">'cause that was the only way I could afford it.</p>
<p class="full-script">mm-hmm.</p>
<p class="full-script">I was 12, and I just wore it around the apartment for months.</p>
<p class="full-script">It was one of the first things that made me want to become a designer.</p>
<p class="full-script">Jenny.</p>
<p class="full-script">yeah? The light.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh.</p>
<p class="full-script">sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">what you want dan if you want never say my name No, I don't wanna get in this right now.</p>
<p class="full-script">If i get avoiding dealing with it last year.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well this is fate that telling us we can.</p>
<p class="full-script">what are you doing? I'm getting out of here.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, someone's coming.</p>
<p class="full-script">The man said so.</p>
<p class="full-script">Right, because someone always come to say Serena Van Der Woodsen.</p>
<p class="full-script">That' not fair.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know it's not.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's not the point.</p>
<p class="full-script">Fine.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know what, life is not fair.</p>
<p class="full-script">Because it doesn't fit with the way you, Dan Humphrey think things should be.</p>
<p class="full-script">But why are you always right? No, I never said that.</p>
<p class="full-script">God hurts.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you sure? I'm sorry, Serena.</p>
<p class="full-script">I forgive you, for Georgina.</p>
<p class="full-script">And I forgive you.</p>
<p class="full-script">ButI don't know.</p>
<p class="full-script">We keep having the same fight.</p>
<p class="full-script">bars and branch.</p>
<p class="full-script">A year ago, at the wedding.</p>

<p class="full-script">So what happens now? I don't really feel like talking.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, me either.</p>

<p class="full-script">b.</p>
<p class="full-script">i.</p>
<p class="full-script">And tell them where nate's dad is hiding out.</p>
<p class="full-script">So I really didn't have a choice.</p>
