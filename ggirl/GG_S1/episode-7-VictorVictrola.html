	<br>	scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
	<br>
	<br>	you'll never believe
	<br>	what's on "gossip girl."
	<br>
	<br>	someone saw serena getting
	<br>	off a train at grand central.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought everything
	<br>	was good between us.
	<br>
	<br>	It was, before I found out
	<br>	you had sex with my boyfriend.
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't come back for you.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, blair's my best friend,and
	<br>	you're her boyfriend, and she loves you.
	<br>
	<br>	You'd really go out with
	<br>	somu guy yodon't know?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, he can't be worse
	<br>	than the guys i do know.
	<br>
	<br>	Loved...you
	<br>
	<br>	Sure
	<br>
	<br>	- Nate?
	<br>	- Serena?!
	<br>
	<br>	Jenny
	<br>
	<br>	Gossip Girl??
	<br>	Season01 Episode07
	<br>
	<br>	2 days earlier
	<br>
	<br>	Where people can be
	<br>	transported to another time,
	<br>
	<br>	where they can feel free to let loose.
	<br>
	<br>	No judgment. Pure escape.
	<br>
	<br>	What happens at victrola
	<br>	stays at victrola.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,it does have franchise potential.
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck bass,I do believe all your years of underage
	<br>	boozing and womanizing have finally paid off.
	<br>
	<br>	Truly,I am proud.
	<br>
	<br>	And you are my toughest critic.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,second toughest.
	<br>
	<br>	So do you think your
	<br>	father will go for it?
	<br>
	<br>	It is exactly the kind of innovative
	<br>	thinking upon which the bass empire was built.
	<br>
	<br>	It is the perfect thing.
	<br>	I've been waiting for this.
	<br>
	<br>	We are so late. Are you coming?
	<br>
	<br>	Gotta pitch it to bart.
	<br>
	<br>	Victory party here tomorrow.
	<br>
	<br>	I wouldn't miss it.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll send a car.
	<br>
	<br>	Don't be nervous.
	<br>
	<br>	He's gonna love it.
	<br>
	<br>	they all seem very discreet.
	<br>
	<br>	It's up to you,but you
	<br>	will choose a facility,
	<br>
	<br>	and you will get the help that you need,
	<br>
	<br>	after our dinner with the
	<br>	waldorfs tomorrow night,of course,
	<br>
	<br>	unless you'd like to ruin the celebration honoring
	<br>	your father's new business union with eleanor.
	<br>
	<br>	Anne,it's all right.
	<br>
	<br>	Let me talk to him.
	<br>
	<br>	how could you not tell
	<br>	her the drugs were yours?
	<br>
	<br>	You're not gonna end up
	<br>	in one of these places.
	<br>
	<br>	Let me talk to ******
	<br>
	<br>	yeah,'cause it's mom
	<br>	who's the problem,right?
	<br>
	<br>	Look,work's been kicking my ass lately.
	<br>
	<br>	The old man doesn't wear the
	<br>	hours as well as he used to.
	<br>
	<br>	This young viper at the
	<br>	office,frank meltzer,
	<br>
	<br>	saw me fading one night,so
	<br>	he offered me a pick-me-up.
	<br>
	<br>	It was stupid. I didn't even like it.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,I'll flush the bag
	<br>	right now,all right?
	<br>
	<br>	Dad,I just
	<br>	want you to be--
	<br>
	<br>	look,let's not put a damper
	<br>	on the upcoming festivities.
	<br>
	<br>	I've landed the waldorf account,
	<br>
	<br>	and my son has landed the waldorf.
	<br>
	<br>	So that's it?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,I'm not cutting
	<br>	the conversation short.
	<br>
	<br>	Drinks after school at the club?
	<br>
	<br>	Nonalcoholic,of course.
	<br>
	<br>	No,you don't understand,vanessa.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay,the store lent
	<br>	it to me for the ball,
	<br>
	<br>	and if I don't find
	<br>	it,blair is gonna kill me.
	<br>
	<br>	It's under her name,and she
	<br>	doesn't even know I went.
	<br>
	<br>	no,alison,I sent that two weeks ago.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad,have you seen a bracelet?
	<br>
	<br>	You know,round,silverish,sparkly?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,I think I saw that next to that
	<br>	ambiguous vague thing by the nondescript place.
	<br>
	<br>	He hasn't seen it.
	<br>
	<br>	No,alison,I-wh--I haven't
	<br>	told them anything yet.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,what should i be telling them
	<br>	when I don't even know what'S...
	<br>
	<br>	who you talking to?
	<br>
	<br>	Your mother.
	<br>
	<br>	Tell her I say hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Jenny says hellowho are you talking to?
	<br>
	<br>	where's the other humphrey?
	<br>
	<br>	- Brick not comfortable.
	<br>	- All right,I'll take one for the team.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,this is definitely
	<br>	not very comfortable.
	<br>
	<br>	I know. You'd think all the money
	<br>	that we spent on this private school,
	<br>
	<br>	they could at least give us a
	<br>	comfortable spot to make out.
	<br>
	<br>	Or a better chemistry teacher.
	<br>
	<br>	Mr.Peiser is a little weird.
	<br>
	<br>	Wait,you're thinking
	<br>	about mr.Peiser right now?
	<br>
	<br>	We are at school.
	<br>
	<br>	hey,serena. Why don't you get a room?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,that's the plight of
	<br>	the manhattan teenager.
	<br>
	<br>	No cars.
	<br>
	<br>	You know,we could find
	<br>	a place more private.
	<br>
	<br>	Our parents aren't always home.
	<br>
	<br>	That's true.
	<br>
	<br>	They must eventually leave.
	<br>
	<br>	The problem is waiting for eventually.
	<br>
	<br>	What's the rush?
	<br>
	<br>	Really,it's not like this sucks.
	<br>
	<br>	Minus the brick and the paparazzi.
	<br>
	<br>	Spotted-- serena
	<br>	and not-so-lonely boy
	<br>
	<br>	clearly past courtship in the courtyard.
	<br>
	<br>	Bye.
	<br>
	<br>	you know,we should
	<br>	talk about this,though,
	<br>
	<br>	- about us,about eventually.
	<br>	- Definitely.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes. Yes.
	<br>
	<br>	Or we could just get it
	<br>	over with in a broom closet.
	<br>
	<br>	in a broom closet? That
	<br>	is-- that is rich,serena.
	<br>
	<br>	Mr.Peiser's waiting.
	<br>
	<br>	But can brooklyn keep up
	<br>	with the uptown express?
	<br>
	<br>	Serena,right?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,that'S... funny.
	<br>
	<br>	- Mm,not really.No.
	<br>	- No.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,what are you doing
	<br>	in the girls' hall?
	<br>
	<br>	I was actually looking for you.
	<br>
	<br>	You know,I really didn't mean anything
	<br>	I said about having feelings for serena.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe you didn'T.
	<br>
	<br>	I just-- I mean,I don't even
	<br>	care,but other people might.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,I know.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,including my brother.
	<br>
	<br>	You brought me chocolates?
	<br>
	<br>	Well,I know you care about
	<br>	being friends with blair,
	<br>
	<br>	and your
	<br>	brother--
	<br>
	<br>	he's with serena,and I'm with blair,
	<br>
	<br>	and I just really need
	<br>	you to help me out here.
	<br>
	<br>	You promise?
	<br>
	<br>	Promise what?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,promise to help me come up with
	<br>	a more creative apology than these.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry for taking you
	<br>	for granted lately,okay?
	<br>
	<br>	That is so sweet!
	<br>
	<br>	But I prefer the gold
	<br>	collection,but thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,cinderella.
	<br>
	<br>	I think you dropped this at the ball.
	<br>
	<br>	I hate secrets more than anything.
	<br>
	<br>	You know that.
	<br>
	<br>	Friends don't lie,and
	<br>	we're friends,right?
	<br>
	<br>	Right.
	<br>
	<br>	Jenny humphrey's rise to the
	<br>	penthouse has been short and sweet,
	<br>
	<br>	but if she crosses blair waldorf,it's
	<br>	straight back to the basement.
	<br>
	<br>	Looks like this little lamb
	<br>	needs to stay silent or else.
	<br>
	<br>	When can I go public with you?
	<br>
	<br>	My kids have to know first.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,your secret's safe with me.
	<br>
	<br>	father.
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck
	<br>	Chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	Um,well...
	<br>
	<br>	bart,um,I think your points
	<br>	earlier were excellent...
	<br>
	<br>	And,um,I plan to bring them up at
	<br>	the next parent/teacher meeting.
	<br>
	<br>	Um,thank you,lily.
	<br>
	<br>	not much future as an actress.
	<br>
	<br>	You don't say anything to serena.
	<br>
	<br>	You don't say anything to anyone.
	<br>
	<br>	Lily would like this to
	<br>	play out in a certain way.
	<br>
	<br>	So you're serious about her?
	<br>
	<br>	What's with the business formal?
	<br>
	<br>	Are you being arraigned for something?
	<br>
	<br>	I have an investment idea I think
	<br>	is utterly unique to your company.
	<br>
	<br>	Something avant-garde,yet nostalgic.
	<br>
	<br>	It is the perfect way for you to
	<br>	loosen the top button of bass,inc.
	<br>
	<br>	Like you've been wanting,sir.
	<br>
	<br>	I am so pleased.
	<br>
	<br>	You are?
	<br>
	<br>	Are you kidding me?
	<br>
	<br>	Do you how long I've been waiting for you to
	<br>	be interested in something other than partying?
	<br>
	<br>	you should come see the place.
	<br>
	<br>	It sells itself.
	<br>
	<br>	I have some
	<br>	meetings,but,uh,how's after--
	<br>
	<br>	a-after's--after's
	<br>	great.
	<br>
	<br>	After's good.
	<br>
	<br>	So...
	<br>
	<br>	I heard on "gossip girl" that you
	<br>	were having sex with dan out here...
	<br>
	<br>	in streaming video.
	<br>
	<br>	God,kati and is filmed us?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,it's all very "high
	<br>	school musical" scandalous.
	<br>
	<br>	and no,they haven't
	<br>	streamed it yet,but...
	<br>
	<br>	I heard it was...
	<br>
	<br>	aggressive.
	<br>
	<br>	I must say,dan has been surprisingly
	<br>	good at everything we've done.
	<br>
	<br>	Which is... everything?
	<br>
	<br>	No!
	<br>
	<br>	but feel free to ask
	<br>	any personal questions.
	<br>
	<br>	But you've talked about it,right?
	<br>
	<br>	No,mom,we haven'T.
	<br>
	<br>	May I remind you that this is
	<br>	your first real boyfriend,S.
	<br>
	<br>	And in relationships,you
	<br>	talk about stuff.
	<br>
	<br>	I know,but I don't know,
	<br>
	<br>	sometimes talking about it or planning
	<br>	it can ruin a good thing,you know?
	<br>
	<br>	I would know.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,as long as you're not worried.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,I'm not,but I
	<br>	don't know,he might be.
	<br>
	<br>	Is it possible for a guy
	<br>	to want to slow things down?
	<br>
	<br>	Only the guys we like.
	<br>
	<br>	but...
	<br>
	<br>	with you,I can't imagine why.
	<br>
	<br>	how was I?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know.
	<br>
	<br>	Let's ask the judges.
	<br>
	<br>	I was gonna give you a
	<br>	3,but since you're a virgin,
	<br>
	<br>	I gave you an extra point.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,i chose to wait.
	<br>
	<br>	Sex is meaningful,like
	<br>	art,and you don't rush art.
	<br>
	<br>	Who's art?
	<br>
	<br>	Did you sleep with him?
	<br>
	<br>	did you sleep with him?
	<br>
	<br>	Did you or did you not sleep with him?
	<br>
	<br>	Yes,alison,i did encourage
	<br>	you to do your paintings,
	<br>
	<br>	not the next door neighbor.
	<br>
	<br>	Hello? Hello?
	<br>
	<br>	ah,dan,I-I didn't
	<br>	realize you were home.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry you had to hear that.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,I did.
	<br>
	<br>	Something about,uh,uh,mom
	<br>	and a neighbor?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,it'S... complicated.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom's having an affair. It's
	<br>	easy when you just say it.
	<br>
	<br>	Not to your son.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,she hasn't exactly
	<br>	been rushing back to us.
	<br>
	<br>	It's good to know why.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm home.
	<br>
	<br>	What's going on,dad?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,nothing.
	<br>
	<br>	Just gotta get some groceries.
	<br>
	<br>	Dan?
	<br>	Dan?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,sorry,jen. I got
	<br>	a lot of homework,so...
	<br>
	<br>	*********away.
	<br>
	<br>	what?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,sorry,nate.
	<br>
	<br>	I have to take a rain
	<br>	check on our drink.
	<br>
	<br>	Why?
	<br>
	<br>	Client in crisis.
	<br>
	<br>	Can't get out of the office,but
	<br>	I'll be home as soon as I can.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,dad,our talk was kind of important.
	<br>
	<br>	It's business,nate.
	<br>	You understand,right?
	<br>
	<br>	We'll talk later.
	<br>
	<br>	looks like parents can be deceiving
	<br>	on both sides of the bridge.
	<br>
	<br>	You are...
	<br>
	<br>	really talented.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad.
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't think you'd make it.
	<br>
	<br>	And you want me to pour
	<br>	hundreds of thousands of dollars
	<br>
	<br>	into an excuse for you to
	<br>	be around booze and women?
	<br>
	<br>	No. No,I...
	<br>
	<br>	did you read the proposal? It
	<br>	shows a much bigger picture.
	<br>
	<br>	I came down here because
	<br>	I saw the effort you made.
	<br>
	<br>	You want to impress me with
	<br>	your commitment to something?
	<br>
	<br>	Try getting a few a's in
	<br>	school or maybe a part-time job.
	<br>
	<br>	Let's go get some lunch.
	<br>
	<br>	looks like the pot calling the kettle
	<br>	black has young bass boiling over,
	<br>
	<br>	and if we know chuck,he's
	<br>	not one to let things lie.
	<br>
	<br>	Someone pour that man a drink.
	<br>
	<br>	You need to look elegant for the archibald
	<br>	dinner tomorrow night,so what do you think?
	<br>
	<br>	Yes,it would be very nice,if I
	<br>	was sailing up on the mayflower.
	<br>
	<br>	Anne archibald was wearing her amazing
	<br>
	<br>	cornelius vanderbilt
	<br>	diamond ring the other night.
	<br>
	<br>	She was going on and on about how
	<br>	it would end up on your finger...
	<br>
	<br>	someday.
	<br>
	<br>	Wait.
	<br>
	<br>	Nate spoke to his
	<br>	mother about our future?
	<br>
	<br>	He actually asked for the family ring?
	<br>
	<br>	looks like cold,hard cash can
	<br>	get you the cold,hard truth.
	<br>
	<br>	Didn't anyone tell you,N.
	<br>
	<br>	Be careful what you fish for.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe we actually
	<br>	got the apartment to ourselves.
	<br>
	<br>	You got downtown pretty fast.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,with an opportunity like
	<br>	this,one needs to take advantage.
	<br>
	<br>	how long do you think till your
	<br>	dad and sister will be back?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,anywhere from an hour to 20 minutes?
	<br>
	<br>	Well,20 minutes is plenty.
	<br>
	<br>	It's kind of bright in
	<br>	here,don't you think?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,maybe get some
	<br>	blinds or A... a clapper.
	<br>
	<br>	Mm,how about next time?
	<br>
	<br>	hey,dan. Hungry?
	<br>
	<br>	hello.
	<br>
	<br>	- Hi.
	<br>	- Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Vanessa,right?
	<br>
	<br>	Good to see you.
	<br>
	<br>	Good to see you.
	<br>
	<br>	And good to see you
	<br>	seeing us seeing you.
	<br>
	<br>	excuse me.
	<br>
	<br>	You really need to
	<br>	start using that door.
	<br>
	<br>	Which you're showing me to.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,practice makes perfect.
	<br>
	<br>	Leaving,out the door.
	<br>
	<br>	And we appreciate it.
	<br>
	<br>	Sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	So do you think we should talk about it?
	<br>
	<br>	You mean about--
	<br>	about vanessa?
	<br>
	<br>	No,you know what? She's like family.
	<br>
	<br>	It feels comfortable,and so therefore,
	<br>
	<br>	she often shows up without calling.
	<br>
	<br>	No,I-I mean about what almost,maybe,
	<br>
	<br>	might have just happened.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,you mean if vanessa
	<br>	hadn't entered,and we...
	<br>
	<br>	or we could not talk about it.
	<br>
	<br>	dan,we're home.
	<br>
	<br>	We got breakfast.
	<br>
	<br>	Hungry?
	<br>
	<br>	Spotted-- bass drunk off
	<br>	his ass at the palace bar,
	<br>
	<br>	drinking away his woes
	<br>	and investment capital.
	<br>
	<br>	Nathaniel,your position in my esteem
	<br>	has been replaced by your voice mail.
	<br>
	<br>	So...
	<br>
	<br>	bart didn't go for vicola,
	<br>
	<br>	but truth is I bought the
	<br>	house out already for tonight,
	<br>
	<br>	and it's not a par-tay without
	<br>	my people or any people.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll see you there.
	<br>
	<br>	long night?
	<br>
	<br>	Alfonso made me an omelet.
	<br>
	<br>	I may have washed it down
	<br>	with a bellini or two.
	<br>
	<br>	You father didn't go for
	<br>	your business proposal.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on.
	<br>
	<br>	Let me help you.
	<br>
	<br>	He was born poor.
	<br>
	<br>	- I was born loaded.
	<br>	- Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	But if the only way to impress
	<br>	him is if I started with nothing,
	<br>
	<br>	then why doesn't he
	<br>	just take it all away?
	<br>
	<br>	because he loves you.
	<br>
	<br>	No good parent likes to
	<br>	see his child go without.
	<br>
	<br>	I had the idea.
	<br>
	<br>	I did the work.
	<br>
	<br>	He tells me I can't be committed,
	<br>
	<br>	and he's the one
	<br>	screwing 25 year olds...
	<br>
	<br>	when he's supposedly committed to you.
	<br>
	<br>	We're newly committed,as
	<br>	recent as last week.
	<br>
	<br>	I wonder why he was pawing some
	<br>	asian chick in his limo yesterday.
	<br>
	<br>	How could I be surprised,really?
	<br>
	<br>	excuse me.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm on my way.
	<br>
	<br>	uh,I'm late for my blowout at arden'S.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom,please.
	<br>
	<br>	The drugs were dad'S.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean,I guess he thought
	<br>	it'd be easier on everyone
	<br>
	<br>	if I took the hit,but they were his.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't understand.
	<br>
	<br>	No,he promised me he'd flush the
	<br>	coke,then I caught him buying more.
	<br>
	<br>	The lengths that you will go
	<br>	to to get out of trouble,nate.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom,he has a problem.
	<br>
	<br>	I need your help,please.
	<br>
	<br>	You look down at the floor every time
	<br>	someone tries to tell you the truth.
	<br>
	<br>	Just look at me. Mom.
	<br>
	<br>	I saw dad buying drugs yesterday.
	<br>
	<br>	He's been under a lot of pressure,
	<br>
	<br>	- and if you hadn't been so difficult lately...
	<br>	- what?
	<br>
	<br>	Your latest rebellions have been
	<br>	very hard on your father,nate.
	<br>
	<br>	All this business with
	<br>	dartmouth,your issues with blair.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom,dad needs your help.
	<br>
	<br>	Not another word of this.
	<br>
	<br>	We have a celebratory dinner to get to.
	<br>
	<br>	Please wear a tie.
	<br>
	<br>	see...
	<br>
	<br>	you curl your fingers into a fist,
	<br>
	<br>	and with simple thrust of
	<br>	force,you knock on the door.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,I didn't use the fire escape.
	<br>
	<br>	Baby steps.
	<br>
	<br>	And what are you doing watching porn?
	<br>
	<br>	It's not porn. It's art cinema.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,from what I saw earlier,you
	<br>	don't need to be doing research.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't talk about this with you.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm curious,though,about
	<br>	the change in your attitude,
	<br>
	<br>	because may I remind you,that
	<br>	in your pale,romantic,
	<br>
	<br>	tortured days,you'd
	<br>	wax on,and I quote,that,
	<br>
	<br>	"sex is meaningful,like
	<br>	art,and you don't rush art."
	<br>
	<br>	That was in,uh,25.
	<br>
	<br>	I was more idealistic then.
	<br>
	<br>	I was much younger,and there wasn't an
	<br>	actual girl who wanted to have sex with me.
	<br>
	<br>	You're...
	<br>
	<br>	going to lose your virginity.
	<br>
	<br>	- Ooh,can you...
	<br>	- my friend dan.
	<br>
	<br>	Please not turn my sex
	<br>	life into a country song?
	<br>
	<br>	It's okay.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sure serena knows what to do,
	<br>
	<br>	what with her vast experiences
	<br>	with boarding school professors,
	<br>
	<br>	pamplonian bullfighters,best
	<br>	friends' boyfriends...
	<br>
	<br>	that's enough now. You can go.Please.
	<br>
	<br>	But if it were me with you...
	<br>
	<br>	I'd want you to hide cedric,
	<br>
	<br>	maybe get some candles and
	<br>	replace the football sheets.
	<br>
	<br>	But...
	<br>
	<br>	- take it or leave it.
	<br>	- Thanks.
	<br>
	<br>	Thanks for helping me
	<br>	out with the bracelet.
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't know a broken
	<br>	clasp could cost that much.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,it was my pleasure.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,wait. No,it wasn'T.
	<br>
	<br>	Game recognizes game,little J.
	<br>
	<br>	But you have to show more respect.
	<br>
	<br>	This is the last time I've helped you.
	<br>
	<br>	Next time you cross me,I
	<br>	won't be as forgiving.
	<br>
	<br>	Don't worry. There won't be a next time.
	<br>
	<br>	Good,'cause I wanna tell you something,
	<br>
	<br>	something nobody knows,not even serena.
	<br>
	<br>	You can keep a secret,right?
	<br>
	<br>	Of course.
	<br>
	<br>	Nate is planning on giving
	<br>	me his family diamond.
	<br>
	<br>	It's the most incredible
	<br>	ring you've ever seen.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,ring as in engagement ring?
	<br>
	<br>	I remember the first
	<br>	time I ever saw him.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe we were just
	<br>	little kids,but I knew--
	<br>
	<br>	he's the one I wanna marry.
	<br>
	<br>	Now it seems like he
	<br>	feels the same way,too.
	<br>
	<br>	Why are you not happy for me?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	It's--it's just been
	<br>	a really weird week.
	<br>
	<br>	Um,there's this stuff with my parents
	<br>	and my family,so maybe I should just go.
	<br>
	<br>	No,maybe you should look at me in the
	<br>	eye and tell me what you're hiding.
	<br>
	<br>	Are you jealous?
	<br>
	<br>	- Of you and nate?
	<br>	- Do you like him?
	<br>
	<br>	What? No.
	<br>
	<br>	Do you think because you talked to him
	<br>	once in the hall that you might have a shot?
	<br>
	<br>	Blair,it's nothing like that.
	<br>
	<br>	Then tell me,what is it like?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't want to hurt you.
	<br>
	<br>	How could you hurt me?
	<br>
	<br>	Yesterday wasn't the first
	<br>	time I talked to nate.
	<br>
	<br>	At the ball,he told me
	<br>	he wasn't over serena.
	<br>
	<br>	Why would he tell you that?
	<br>
	<br>	'Cause I was wearing her
	<br>	mask,and he thought I was her.
	<br>
	<br>	He kissed me.
	<br>
	<br>	That's enough.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair,I-I didn't want you to find out.
	<br>
	<br>	You're dismissed,jenny...
	<br>
	<br>	for good.
	<br>
	<br>	You look beautiful tonight.
	<br>
	<br>	Anything on your mind?
	<br>
	<br>	No.
	<br>
	<br>	Is there anything you wanna say?
	<br>
	<br>	No.
	<br>
	<br>	the leg wrap--
	<br>	that's interesting.
	<br>
	<br>	Sexy,right?
	<br>
	<br>	And it increases stability.
	<br>
	<br>	Sure. Yeah,I can see that.
	<br>
	<br>	the hair grab-- does
	<br>	that really work?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,yeah. Every time.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay,so leg wrap to hair grab.
	<br>
	<br>	Do... hold on a second.
	<br>
	<br>	Do--do I have to keep my shirt
	<br>	open and billowing like that?
	<br>
	<br>	Well,it never hurts.
	<br>
	<br>	Nice.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm--I'm
	<br>	doomed.
	<br>
	<br>	"sensuous massage."
	<br>
	<br>	Something we suld talk about?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,uh,no.
	<br>
	<br>	You know,I have a lot
	<br>	of-- a lot of tension,
	<br>
	<br>	stress in between my,um,shoulder blades.
	<br>
	<br>	so...
	<br>
	<br>	I'm headed to the gallery to,uh,test
	<br>	run a 24-hour projection installation.
	<br>
	<br>	Vanessa and jenny are over
	<br>	there. Do you want to come?
	<br>
	<br>	Um,24 hours is a very long
	<br>	time to be working straight.
	<br>
	<br>	So I think I might just chill here.
	<br>
	<br>	Alone?
	<br>
	<br>	On a saturday night?
	<br>
	<br>	With your new girlfriend?
	<br>
	<br>	Son...
	<br>
	<br>	dad,we've had the talk already.
	<br>
	<br>	Do you need a refresher?
	<br>
	<br>	Etched in my brain. Thanks.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,just be safe.
	<br>
	<br>	Don't do anything you're not
	<br>	ready to do--or she's not.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,and,uh,lose the football sheets...
	<br>
	<br>	and cedric.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,you look pretty
	<br>	good for a dead messenger.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought I was doing the right thing.
	<br>
	<br>	You did.
	<br>
	<br>	Now blair knows the truth,and
	<br>	she and nate can talk about it.
	<br>
	<br>	Honest communication is what every
	<br>	good relationship is based on,
	<br>
	<br>	at least,that's what I hear.
	<br>
	<br>	I just--I think how
	<br>	I'd feel,you know,
	<br>
	<br>	if I loved someone,and they betrayed me.
	<br>
	<br>	How would you ever get things
	<br>	back to the way they were?
	<br>
	<br>	Wait,are we still talking
	<br>	about blair and nate here?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,of course.
	<br>
	<br>	What else can we be talking about?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know. Your parents?
	<br>
	<br>	Look,maybe you don't go
	<br>	back,maybe you go forward.
	<br>
	<br>	Get two people in a room
	<br>	willing to be balls-out honest?
	<br>
	<br>	It might get ugly,but eventually,
	<br>
	<br>	the dust has to settle,
	<br>
	<br>	and then you can see if there's hope.
	<br>
	<br>	We've celebrated the partnership,
	<br>
	<br>	but I don't think we've
	<br>	given eleanor her just due.
	<br>
	<br>	This lady is fantastic.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,well,uh,thank you,howard.
	<br>
	<br>	More cheese?
	<br>
	<br>	Have you tried the humboldt
	<br>	fog? It's quite good.
	<br>
	<br>	Eleanor's right. Enough business talk.
	<br>
	<br>	Right.
	<br>
	<br>	Let's focus on our families'
	<br>	other joint venture--
	<br>
	<br>	the union of our children.
	<br>
	<br>	I have to say,every time
	<br>	I look at anne's finger
	<br>
	<br>	- and see blair's future engagement ring...
	<br>	- yes.
	<br>
	<br>	I can hardly contain my joy.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair,why don't you try it on?
	<br>
	<br>	No,thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	It's all right.
	<br>
	<br>	- yes,I would like to see it.
	<br>	- Anne,give it to blair.
	<br>
	<br>	dad,she doesn't want to try on the ring.
	<br>
	<br>	Howie,why don't we just let it alone?
	<br>
	<br>	just give it to the girl,anne.
	<br>
	<br>	Eleanor,do we have another bottle?
	<br>
	<br>	If there was ever an occasion
	<br>	for the toast,this is it.
	<br>
	<br>	They're gonna make
	<br>	such a beautiful couple.
	<br>
	<br>	Now come on.
	<br>
	<br>	Slide that thing on.
	<br>
	<br>	that's what I'm talking about,huh?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,it's very pretty.
	<br>
	<br>	- It looks magnificent to me.
	<br>	- Thank you
	<br>
	<br>	- Everybody,yeah?Yeah?
	<br>	- it's perfect on her.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,now how about that toast? Come on.
	<br>
	<br>	Everybody,bottoms up.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad,why don't we go smoke
	<br>	the cigars we got,huh?
	<br>
	<br>	Good idea. Excuse us.
	<br>
	<br>	Certainly.
	<br>
	<br>	- this seat taken?
	<br>	- Father.
	<br>
	<br>	The light of day doesn't
	<br>	do this place any justice.
	<br>
	<br>	I told him he had to check it out
	<br>	when the joint was in full swing.
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck,this is pauletta cho.
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck bass. Pleasure.
	<br>
	<br>	All mine.
	<br>
	<br>	Pauletta interviewed me for that
	<br>	recent piece in "the observer,"
	<br>
	<br>	roped me into a lunch yesterday to pitch me on
	<br>	the idea of helping her with a career change.
	<br>
	<br>	What can I say?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm tired of reporting on titans.
	<br>
	<br>	I wanna be one myself.
	<br>
	<br>	Right. Well,uh,who better
	<br>	to help than my father?
	<br>
	<br>	As a test,I gave her your proposal
	<br>	that I was given to take a look at.
	<br>
	<br>	The math was fine,
	<br>
	<br>	but what interested me was the wish
	<br>	fulfillment quality to the report.
	<br>
	<br>	So perhaps,some,uh,
	<br>
	<br>	d-school thinking and fatherly
	<br>	bias clouded my judgment.
	<br>
	<br>	What do you say?
	<br>
	<br>	I love the idea of being a
	<br>	patron of burgeoning talent.
	<br>
	<br>	Shall we take a full tour?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	You know,I've been trying
	<br>	to get ahold of lily,
	<br>
	<br>	but,uh,I don't seem able to.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,dad.
	<br>
	<br>	there's something I have to tell you.
	<br>
	<br>	- dad,you have a problem.
	<br>	- I don't have a problem.
	<br>
	<br>	You're tweaked and embarrassing.
	<br>
	<br>	- You're trying to tell me you don't have a problem?
	<br>	- Don't be so dramatic.
	<br>
	<br>	No,you reminded me every day how
	<br>	important this business deal is to you.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean,you've been selling me
	<br>	out trying to make it happen,
	<br>
	<br>	pushing me towards
	<br>	dartmouth,towards blair.
	<br>
	<br>	You don't understand.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad,you're totally
	<br>	sabotaging all of it tonight.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,who the hell are you to tell me?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm the adult. You're the kid.
	<br>
	<br>	I know.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm going back inside.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad,don'T.
	<br>
	<br>	Nate,let go of me.
	<br>
	<br>	- what's going on here?
	<br>	- Nothing.He's my son.
	<br>
	<br>	Is everything all right?
	<br>
	<br>	I said everything's fine.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not asking you.
	<br>
	<br>	Sorry,dad. You need help.
	<br>
	<br>	Check his pockets while you're at it.
	<br>
	<br>	All right,sir,just relax.
	<br>
	<br>	My father went home sick.
	<br>
	<br>	Spotted on 5th avenue--
	<br>	a father and son showdown.
	<br>
	<br>	Too bad not all the
	<br>	witnesses can be bought off.
	<br>
	<br>	she's not taking my calls.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe you did this.
	<br>
	<br>	I made a mistake.
	<br>
	<br>	This isn't high school,chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sure she'll take you
	<br>	back once you explain.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not so certain about that.
	<br>
	<br>	If she doesn't,I'm not
	<br>	sure that's my fault.
	<br>
	<br>	There's a reason she was
	<br>	so quick to believe me.
	<br>
	<br>	There's a fire-eater
	<br>	in the ladies lounge.
	<br>
	<br>	you two should set a meeting,see if
	<br>	this place can really be something.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm gonna try and
	<br>	find lily and fix this.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm going to victrola.
	<br>
	<br>	I promised chuck. It's important to him.
	<br>
	<br>	I saw your father get arrested.
	<br>
	<br>	Why didn't you come to me?
	<br>
	<br>	I would've listened.
	<br>
	<br>	I've tried,blair.
	<br>
	<br>	But every time I try,something's
	<br>	got your attention--
	<br>
	<br>	a dinner party,you know,a masked ball.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,let's talk about that masked ball.
	<br>
	<br>	Let's talk about how while I was
	<br>	waiting for you to find me so that
	<br>
	<br>	we could finally be together,
	<br>
	<br>	you were confessing your
	<br>	feelings and kissing serena.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought I was doing everything right.
	<br>
	<br>	It's not your fault.
	<br>
	<br>	Do you love me?
	<br>
	<br>	you should deal with your father.
	<br>
	<br>	He needs you.
	<br>
	<br>	You know what?
	<br>
	<br>	I don'T.
	<br>
	<br>	okay,I'm ready.
	<br>
	<br>	May I?
	<br>
	<br>	I know it may not compare to,uh,
	<br>
	<br>	a suite at the ritz in
	<br>	paris or a chalet in aspen,
	<br>
	<br>	and it might be a fire hazard,but...
	<br>
	<br>	it's perfect.
	<br>
	<br>	Where's nate?
	<br>
	<br>	- I think we just broke up.
	<br>	- What?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't want to talk about it.
	<br>
	<br>	I just want to escape.
	<br>
	<br>	That's what this place is for,right?
	<br>
	<br>	I know you don't want to
	<br>	talk about what happened,but--
	<br>
	<br>	relief.
	<br>
	<br>	I feel relief.
	<br>
	<br>	you know,I got moves.
	<br>
	<br>	Really?
	<br>
	<br>	Then why don't you get up there?
	<br>
	<br>	no,I'm just saying,I have moves.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on,you're ten times
	<br>	hotter than any of those girls.
	<br>
	<br>	I know what you're doing,bass.
	<br>
	<br>	you really don't think I'd go up there.
	<br>
	<br>	I know you won't do it.
	<br>
	<br>	guard my drink.
	<br>
	<br>	who's that girl?
	<br>
	<br>	I have no idea.
	<br>
	<br>	You go,baby vamp.
	<br>
	<br>	as you might have
	<br>	guessed,upper east siders,
	<br>
	<br>	prohibition never stood a
	<br>	chance against exhibition.
	<br>
	<br>	It's human nature to be free.
	<br>
	<br>	And no matter how long you try to be
	<br>	good,you can't keep a bad girl down.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,this is a new strain
	<br>	of obsessive-compulsive.
	<br>
	<br>	The,uh,art piece projects
	<br>	up to the ceiling.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,still doing anything to
	<br>	get a girl on her back,huh?
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing here,lil?
	<br>
	<br>	let me ask you that
	<br>	question another way.
	<br>
	<br>	Did you break up with bart again?
	<br>
	<br>	Well,what did I do to
	<br>	deserve such a thorny welcome?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry. I'm really not
	<br>	in the mood to play games.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know what's happening
	<br>	with my wife or my marriage,
	<br>
	<br>	and you showing up here randomly
	<br>
	<br>	and often doesn't make
	<br>	figuring that out any easier.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry I bothered you,really.
	<br>
	<br>	Lil,wait.
	<br>
	<br>	You know,if you wanna stay and see the,
	<br>
	<br>	uh,installation,I could
	<br>	really use the company.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,I don't want to be in your way.
	<br>
	<br>	Van Der Woodsen
	<br>	Since when,van der woodsen?
	<br>
	<br>	I've been meaning to get that fixed.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm really happy to be
	<br>	here with you right now.
	<br>
	<br>	wait.
	<br>
	<br>	What? What,did I do something wrong?
	<br>
	<br>	- No.
	<br>	- I knew the hair thing was too much.
	<br>
	<br>	No.
	<br>
	<br>	No,it's just,um...
	<br>
	<br>	um,"um" is never good.
	<br>
	<br>	What? I... I'm scared.
	<br>
	<br>	of me?
	<br>
	<br>	No.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,yes,but...
	<br>
	<br>	no,it's just--
	<br>	I've never,um...
	<br>
	<br>	you've--you've
	<br>	never-- you're not...
	<br>
	<br>	- no.
	<br>	- All right.
	<br>
	<br>	No,I-I wish.
	<br>
	<br>	It's just,nobody's ever looked
	<br>	at me the way you just did.
	<br>
	<br>	In fact,I don't think
	<br>	they looked at me at all.
	<br>
	<br>	You think I'm crazy,don't you?
	<br>
	<br>	no. No,I don'T.
	<br>
	<br>	Are you mad?
	<br>
	<br>	come here.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom,hey.
	<br>
	<br>	What's going on?
	<br>
	<br>	What do you think?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm headed down to the police station.
	<br>
	<br>	The lawyers will meet me there along with
	<br>	someone from the district attorney's office.
	<br>
	<br>	Wait,what?
	<br>
	<br>	Why can't we just pay his bail?
	<br>
	<br>	His bail is set at a miion dollars.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you talking about?
	<br>	It wasn't even that much coke.
	<br>
	<br>	It seems your father is
	<br>	facing some other charges.
	<br>
	<br>	For what?
	<br>
	<br>	Embezzlement and fraud.
	<br>
	<br>	I guess they've been building
	<br>	their case for a while.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,are you coming?
	<br>
	<br>	mom...
	<br>
	<br>	it's time for you to come home.
	<br>
	<br>	You sure?
