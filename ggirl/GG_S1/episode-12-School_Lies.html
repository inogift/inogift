	  <h3>	Season01 Episode12 	</h3>
	<br>
	<br>	On the upper east side, it's easy to think
	<br>	that the world is exactly as it appears--
	<br>	refined, elegant, imposing.
	<br>
	<br>	But sometimes, all it takes is a little key
	<br>	to open the door to the wild side.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Blair</b> Nate.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Nate</b> Why have you been avoiding me?
	<br>
	<br>	<b>Blair</b> Avoiding you?
	<br>	What?
	<br>
	<br> <b>Nate</b>	Ever since I got back from monaco, you've been-
	<br>  - you're not returning my calls or my texts.
	<br>	- I've barely seen you.

	<br> <b>Blair</b>	- Really?
	<br>	I don't recall.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Nate</b>	Well, do you recall that night after the debutante ball
	<br>
	<br> <b>Blair</b>Yes, I do.
	<br>
	<br> <i> Nate kissed to blair </i>

	<br> <b>Nate</b>	Blair?
	<br>
	<br> <b>Blair</b> What are you doing?
	<br>
	<br>  <b>Chuck</b>	This.
	<br>	Good catching up.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Blair</b>	Enough with the blackmail.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Chuck</b> Aren't you bored already?
	<br>
	<br> <b>Blair</b>	I can't avoid nate forever.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Chuck</b> 	Excuse me.
	<br> I didn't say forever.
	<br>	Just until the sight of the two of you together doesn't turn my stomach.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Blair</b>	And when will that be?
	<br>
	<br>	Only time will tell, I'm afraid.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Chuck</b>  So unless you want dear nathaniel to know
	<br>	how you lost your virginity to me
	<br>	in the back of a moving vehicle,
	<br>
	<br> <b>Blair</b>	I encourage patience and restraint.
	<br> - Isn't there someone else you can torture?
	<br>
	<br> <b>Chuck</b> 	Probably, but I choose you.
	<br>
	<br>	Why don't I turn that, uh, one-piece into a no-piece?
	<br>
	<br> <b>Blair</b>	Find a floatie to talk to, chuck.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Chuck</b> 	You know, if my dad and your mom come back
	<br>	from south africa tomorrow engaged,  we'll be brother and sister.
	<br>
	<br>	And you know what they say--
	<br>	the family that plays together stays together.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Serena</b> 	Ah, incest-- the universal taboo.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Chuck</b>	One of the, um, only ones you haven't violated.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, I'm game if you are.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Vanessa</b>	Dan humphrey, age 17, enjoying an exotic meal of cheerios on an exciting saturday night in.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b>	Come on.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Vanessa</b>	Be interesting.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b>		You don't want me to move back to vermont, do you?
	<br>
	<br> <b>Vanessa</b>	No, but if your whole future depends
	<br>	getting this grant for your documentary,
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b>	I-I really, really think you should find a new subject.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Vanessa</b>	Absolutely not.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b>		The outsider goes inside--
	<br>	a likable everyman's pursuit of his dream girl begins
	<br>	his descent into the bowels of hell.
	<br>
	<br>> <b>Vanessa</b>		This is mythic stuff.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b>		Okay, not big on the soundtrack.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Vanessa</b>	Whatever movie he's scoring sounds depressing.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b>		Yeah, I think it's a biopic.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Vanessa</b>	Try listening to that for three weeks straight.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b>		But before christmas, my dad hadn't finished a song in years,
	<br>
	<br>	so I really don't have the heart to ask him to stop.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Vanessa</b>		Well, I do.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b>	(Phone Call)	Hey, serena.
	<br>
  <br> <b>Vanessa</b>	Yes!
	<br>	Finally some action.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b> What are you up to...
  <br>
	<br> <b>Serena</b>		Besides missing me?
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b> 	Oh, uh, just wondering if you're missing me.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Serena</b>	Well, of course I am, at this party that 	would be a lot more fun if you were here.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b> 	Party?
	<br>	I thought it was a quiet night with blair, your last night
	<br>	at her place before your mom comes home?
	<br>
	<br> <b>Serena</b>	Yeah, we were, and then kati and is showed up,	<br>
	<br>	and we all went out, and we ran into some people and then ended up here.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b> Where- -where's here?
	<br>
	<br> <b>Serena</b>	719 e.
	<br>	82nd stre.
	<br>
	<br>  <b>Dan</b> 	Wait a second.
	<br>	That's, um... That's school, is it not?
	<br>
	<br> <b>Serena</b>	Bring your bathing suit!
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b> 	You're swimming?
	<br>
	<br> <b>Serena</b>	No, you hung up.
	<br>
	<br>	<b>Vanessa</b>	So what will it be, dan-- cheerios and chaucer or an illegal party
	<br>	at your prep school pool with your high  society girlfriend and her nasty cohorts?
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b> Dad? Vanessa and I are--are going out.
	<br>
	<br>  <b>Rufus</b> 	All right.
	<br>
	<br>	* i wish at w wcould talk about it *
	<br>
	<br>	* but there *
	<br>
	<br>	* that's the problem *
	<br>
	<br>	* with someone new I could have started it *
	<br>
	<br>	* too late for beginnings *
	<br>
	<br>	* the little things that made me harassed *
	<br>
	<br> <b>Dan</b> 	Well, uh, if you wanted to get the perfect shot of me feeling like an outsider,
	<br> then i'm ready for my close-up.
	<br>
	<br>	- Hehe vanessa.
	<br>	- Hey.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Serena</b>	Come on, guys.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Teens</b>	Help!
	<br>
	<br> <b>Nate</b>		Call the ambulance!
	<br>	Call an ambulance.
	<br>
	<br>	<b>Nate</b> Someone call 9-1-1.
	<br>
	<br> <b>Serena</b> 	We--we need-- we need an ambulance.
	<br>	Yeah, a-a kid-- he--he hit his head, and--and he fell in the pool.
	<br>	It--it's 719, uh, east 82nd street.
	<br>
  <br> <i> In Schook </i>
	<br> <b>Vice Pricipal</b>	Thanks to the cell phone that somebody left behind, x
	<br>	we've got plenty of evidence of who was at the party.
	<br>	Lucky for you, andrew collins is going to be fine.
	<br>	Unlucky for you, we need to hold someone responsible.
	<br>	Ms.Queller?
	<br>
	<br> <b> Ms.Queller </b>		Hello.
	<br>	I'm ms.Queller, the new headmistress at constance.
	<br>	It's unfortunate that we meet under these circumstances.
	<br>	But I look forward to getting to know each and every one of you.
	<br>	I've already talked to your parents...
	<br>	At least, those I could reach, and look forward to reading your personal essays
	<br>	-- 10,000 words describing how you came to be on school property after hours,
	<br>	using alcohol and drugs, where a fellow student almost died.
	<br>
	<br> - In other words, what the hell is wrong with you?
	<br>	I'll also be conducting one-on-one interviews
	<br>	until i discover who broke into the pool and initiated the party.
	<br>
	<br> - That person will be expelled.
	<br>	If that person is not identified, then you'll all face expulsion.
  <br>
	<br> <b> Blair </b>		So we all know how this works.
	<br>	Look, no one talks, no one gets into trouble.
  <br>
	<br> <b> Nate </b>	Who did break in, anyway?
	<br>
	<br> <b> Blair </b>	I guess we don't he to worry about Nate cracking under pressure.
	<br>	<br>	So are we all agreed?
	<br>
	<br> <b> All </b>	Agreed.
	<br> <b> Nate </b>	Look, blair, I-I know you have your sights set on yale,
	<br>	but this-this skull and bones stuff is a bit much, don't you think?
	<br>
	<br> <b> Blair </b>		Maybe, but it works...
  <br>
	<br>	Every time.
	<br>
	<br>	You know, when someone says "every time,"
	<br>
	<br>	It sounds like--like--like more than a few times.
	<br>
	<br> <b> Blair </b>		Erything's gonna be fine.
	<br>
	<br> <b> Dan </b>		Were you just in the same assembly as me?
	<br>
	<br> <b> Serena </b>		Do you really think she's gonna expel two-thirds of the junior class?
	<br>	Look, I got you into this.
	<br>
	<br> <b> Dan </b>		I'm gonna get you out of it, okay?
	<br>
	<br> <b> Serena </b>	Trust me.
	<br>
	<br>	 <b> Gossip Girl </b>There's a weak link in every chain, x
	<br>
	<br>	it sounds like--like--like more than a few times.
	<br>
	<br>	?????????
	<br>
	<br> <b> Blair </b>		I'm innocent.
	<br>	Well...	<br>
	<br>	Except for a crime of passion.
	<br>	I did something stupid with someone.
	<br>	And even worse than doing that stupid thing,
	<br>	i did the same stupid thing with someone else
	<br>	and pretended I had never done that stupid thing before.
	<br>
	<br> <b> Ms.Queller </b>	You look confused.
	<br>
	<br> <b> Blair </b>		Should I walk you through it?
	<br>
	<br> <b> Ms.Queller </b>	Let's stay on point.
	<br>	I reviewed your record.
	<br>	It's pristine.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Blair </b> If constance has a shining star, it's blair waldorf.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Ms.Queller </b>I would never have expected this from you.
	<br>
	<br> <b> Blair </b>	I know.
	<br>	I'm the perfect one.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Ms.Queller </b> Ms.waldorf, who broke into the pool?
	<br>	Like you said, my unfortunate participation in said party was entirely out of character.
	<br>
	<br> <b> Blair </b>	I don't know anything about it.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Chuck </b>	You're taking that paper seriously.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Nate </b>	This isn't a paper.
	<br>	It's...
	<br>	It's a heartfelt letter to blair.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Chuck </b>	A heartfelt letter?
  <br>	Who spayed you, man?
	<br>	Blair doesn't even want you.
	<br>	She's been crystal about that since we got back.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Nate </b>		Didn't seem that way en she kissed me at the pool.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Chuck </b>	She kissed you?
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Nate </b>		Well, i kissed her, but...
	<br>
	<br>	Yep.
	<br>
	<br>	What was she like?
	<br>
	<br>	Into it? Or was she more like-
	<br>
	<br>	- of course she was into it, man.
	<br>	What do you think?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, i know, but, uh...
	<br>
	<br>	You know blair...
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, I do.
	<br>
	<br>	I think she wants me to suffer a little more.
	<br>	You know, even the playing field?
	<br>
	<br>	It's worth it, believe me.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Dan </b> Hey, dad.
	<br> Listen, uh, I-I got your 1,001 messages.
	<br>	I just haven't had a chance to get back to ya.
	<br>	Yeah, that's not gonna work.
	<br>	I guess you heard from the new headmistress.
  <br>	Look, I know how upset you were by everything,
	<br>  and apparently, some of the kids who were at the party didn't even tell their parents.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Rufus </b> Look, you don't have to say anything else.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Dan </b>	I-I regret even leaving the house saturday.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Rufus </b> 	Yeah, but if you know something that could keep you out of trouble,
	<br>	then you need to cooperate.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Dan </b>	I don't.
	<br>	I--really, dad, i don't.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Rufus </b> 		Dan, don't think for a second these other kids
	<br>	aren't gonna be looking out for themselves.
	<br>	You need to do the same.
	<br>	All right?
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Dan </b>	I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
	<br>	I just got a message that our kids are in some kind of trouble at school.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Rufus </b>	And you came all the way to brooklyn to talk about it?
	<br>
	<br>	<b>  Lily </b>No, no, not about that.
	<br>	- Um, Bart and I just landed at the airport back from our trip,
	<br>	and he proposed, and I'm going to say yes.
  <br>	I wanted you to hear it from me first, not from my daughter or your son.
	<br>
	<br>	<b> Rufus </b>	Right, the people who actually talk to me.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, if you're referring to the message you left me on christmas day,
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't get it until we were already on the plane.
	<br>
	<br>	It was very endearing, though.
	<br>
	<br>	But not enough to turn the g5 around?
	<br>
	<br>	You miss me.That's great.
	<br>	I miss you, too.
	<br>
	<br>	What?
	<br>
	<br>	You kissed me at eleanor's party, and then you say you can't see me anymore
	<br>
	<br>	because your wife came home, and then you call and say you should've never let me go,
	<br>
	<br>	and then you're back with alison again.
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't plan any of that.
	<br>
	<br>	That is just it with you, rufus.
	<br>
	<br>	You don't even plan anything.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i'm sure that your current plan will be full of private jets and 5-star hotels.
	<br>
	<br>	Take care, rufus.
	<br>
	<br>	Do you really have to show this to me now?
	<br>
	<br>	Trust me when i say you're gonna wanna see this
	<br>
	<br>	before you enter blair waldorf's evil lair.
	<br>
	<br>	It's a homework group, vanessa.
	<br>
	<br>	We're just gonna be writing papers, you know?
	<br>
	<br>	Here.
	<br>
	<br>	I wasn't sure what it was till i got it home
	<br>
	<br>	and saw it on the computer, but--
	<br>
	<br>	okay, that's chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you holding here?
	<br>
	<br>	It's a key.
	<br>
	<br>	Spotted--lonely boy learning that when the punishment fits the crime,
	<br>
	<br>	there's no reason you can't serve your sentence in style.
	<br>
	<br>	Yay!
	<br>
	<br>	You're here.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought we were gonna work on our papers.
	<br>
	<br>	We are.
	<br>
	<br>	One night at bilboquet, kati and is made out with a guy in cornell's ethics program.
	<br>
	<br>	They're getting tips now.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought i told you you couldn't film me.
	<br>
	<br>	Come here.
	<br>
	<br>	You are so naive.
	<br>
	<br>	Michael moore over there is obviously just using this film to get close to dan.
	<br>
	<br>	No, she needs that grant money.
	<br>
	<br>	So did you bring your legal pad?
	<br>
	<br>	You wait here.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll find us a quiet place to work.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe you brought that here.
	<br>
	<br>	It's evidence.
	<br>	Give it to me.
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	You need to tell the truth.
	<br>
	<br>	Whatever happened to "don't speak until spoken to"?
	<br>
	<br>	I just saw you with that key.
	<br>
	<br>	I know you had it at the party.
	<br>
	<br>	Poor little humphrey dumpty.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, let me clarify something for you.
	<br>
	<br>	Regardless of who you're currently sleeping with,
	<br>
	<br>	you and i come from different worlds.
	<br>
	<br>	In my world, if i'm suspended or expelled, a wing is donated in the bass name.
	<br>
	<br>	That sounds like quite a world.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, it's not perfect, i'll admit.
	<br>
	<br>	But one thing it does offer in spades is security.
	<br>
	<br>	My family can take care of me.
	<br>
	<br>	What do the humphreys have to offer?
	<br>
	<br>	Used metrocards?
	<br>
	<br>	Your dad's cassingle?
	<br>
	<br>	And in case you were wondering, you narc,
	<br>
	<br>	i only took the key from the party to hide it so we didn't all get blamed...
	<br>
	<br>	Including you.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair.
	<br>
	<br>	Nate.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing here?
	<br>
	<br>	I, uh, wanted to talk to you.
	<br>
	<br>	I brought you this.
	<br>
	<br>	It's a love letter.
	<br>
	<br>	A hostess can't hide in her room.
	<br>
	<br>	It's unladylike.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, where are you going?
	<br>
	<br>	I made us a study area in the other room.
	<br>
	<br>	You know what?
	<br>	I'm just gonna write my paper at home.
	<br>
	<br>	I-i think--i think chuck is right.
	<br>
	<br>	Wait.Chuck?
	<br>	No, don't listen to him.
	<br>
	<br>	No, the guy has a point, actually.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe the reason none of you guys take this seriously is because for you it's not.
	<br>
	<br>	No, it is.
	<br>
	<br>	Just trust me, okay?
	<br>
	<br>	Vanessa, please, some space.
	<br>	I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	Sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, i'm all for loyalty and i'm all for sticking together,
	<br>
	<br>	but we are not in the same boat here.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm on a partial scholarship.
	<br>
	<br>	My parents have no way of buying my way back into this school, or any other.
	<br>
	<br>	And i know this isn't going to be a popular opinion with--with your band of brothers,
	<br>
	<br>	but if the person who brought that key refuses to step up,
	<br>
	<br>	then anybody who knows anything has the right to say something.
	<br>
	<br>	Do--do you know who it is?
	<br>
	<br>	You do, don't you, and you're not gonna say anything?
	<br>
	<br>	Dan, please.
	<br>
	<br>	You don't understand.
	<br>
	<br>	You're right.
	<br>
	<br>	I-i mean, i don't understand.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, let go of me, bass.
	<br>
	<br>	Drop your archibald habit first.
	<br>
	<br>	You know i already have.
	<br>
	<br>	Really?A kiss does sort of
	<br>	send the wrong signal.
	<br>
	<br>	Let's not waste time denying.
	<br>
	<br>	You know what?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm tired of this.
	<br>
	<br>	Go ahead and tell him.
	<br>
	<br>	Really?
	<br>
	<br>	You want me to tell him how you slept with me
	<br>
	<br>	and then faked your virginity for him?
	<br>
	<br>	I'll just tell him you're lying.
	<br>
	<br>	And who do you think he'll believe?
	<br>
	<br>	You, who bangs anything in his field of vision, or me,
	<br>
	<br>	his pure and honest girlfriend of many years?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, now he'll believe me.
	<br>
	<br>	Why?
	<br>
	<br>	I have proof.
	<br>
	<br>	Good eye, docu-girl.
	<br>	I'll take the tape now.
	<br>
	<br>	You knew she was watching?
	<br>
	<br>	This is my house.
	<br>
	<br>	That tape belongs to me.
	<br>
	<br>	Actually, this is my footage, and thanks to both of you,
	<br>
	<br>	i think i got a new angle on my subject.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, vanessa, let's get out of here.
	<br>
	<br>	If you think i'm gonna...
	<br>
	<br>	- Let go of me.
	<br>	- Let you walk out of here with that tape, you're crazy.
	<br>
	<br>	Last time i checked, i still owe you a black eye.
	<br>
	<br>	So unless this is you coming to claim it, stay away from her.
	<br>
	<br>	Now that sex and lies have been caught on videotape, v.'S documentary
	<br>
	<br>	just became the most anticipated new release of the year.
	<br>
	<br>	Rufus.
	<br>	What are you doing here?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not leaving a message for you from the courtyard this time.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i can see that.
	<br>
	<br>	But five minutes ago, my kids would've--
	<br>
	<br>	why did you really come to see me yesterday?
	<br>
	<br>	I told you.
	<br>
	<br>	- Out of respect for-
	<br>	- respect or regret?
	<br>
	<br>	You wanted me to give you a reason not to
	<br>
	<br>	spend the rest of your life with bart bass.
	<br>
	<br>	Rufus...
	<br>
	<br>	I'm still in love with you.
	<br>
	<br>	So what exactly are you offering, rufus?
	<br>
	<br>	Some retrospective of the way we were over a decade ago?
	<br>
	<br>	Look, we're not 20 and on the road.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank god we're not, because your mother made
	<br>
	<br>	this decision for you back then, remember?
	<br>
	<br>	Yes.
	<br>
	<br>	Look...
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know exactly what it would even mean for us to be together.
	<br>
	<br>	But can you look at me and tell me you're not the least bit curious?
	<br>
	<br>	You're at the same crossroads you were years ago.
	<br>
	<br>	Claim your life this time.
	<br>
	<br>	Live it the way you want to live it.
	<br>
	<br>	I did it.
	<br>
	<br>	I broke into the school.
	<br>
	<br>	After all your family has been through this year,
	<br>
	<br>	i'm surprised to learn that you're behind something like this.
	<br>
	<br>	I know, i know.
	<br>
	<br>	And i apologize.
	<br>
	<br>	From what i can see, you always seem to be toeing the line of mediocrity, nathaniel.
	<br>
	<br>	Your grades are average at best,
	<br>
	<br>	almost as though you're not committed to school or your future.
	<br>
	<br>	Can we just move on to the punishment part of this meeting, please?
	<br>
	<br>	Certainly.
	<br>
	<br>	But i'm curious.
	<br>
	<br>	Can you please describe how you broke into the school?
	<br>
	<br>	I can do betr.
	<br>	I can show you.
	<br>
	<br>	And how did you get access to this key?
	<br>
	<br>	You're not on the swim team.
	<br>
	<br>	Not a janitor, right?
	<br>
	<br>	No.
	<br>
	<br>	Where's the key chain?
	<br>
	<br>	The key chain?
	<br>
	<br>	Do you remember its color?
	<br>
	<br>	Size?
	<br>
	<br>	What it's made of?
	<br>
	<br>	Anything at all?
	<br>
	<br>	Who are you trying to protect?
	<br>
	<br>	May i have a word?
	<br>
	<br>	Off camera.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, sure.
	<br>
	<br>	But i think i know what you're gonna say.
	<br>
	<br>	And i can save you the indignity of groveling by telling you right now
	<br>
	<br>	--no way are you gonna get that tape.
	<br>
	<br>	I wasn't going to grovel, and the fact that you even went there
	<br>
	<br>	makes it clear you have no idea who you're dealing with.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you gonna do to me, blair?
	<br>
	<br>	Blackball me from eating yogurt on the met steps?
	<br>
	<br>	You have nothing i need.
	<br>
	<br>	You put that footage in your film, you won't be able to show it.
	<br>
	<br>	I won't sign a release.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not looking for a distribution deal, just a local arts grant so i can pay my rent.
	<br>
	<br>	Now if you'll excuse me...
	<br>
	<br>	You're in my shot.
	<br>
	<br>	What's that, your stripper money?
	<br>
	<br>	$10,000 for the tape.
	<br>
	<br>	You think i'd take your money?
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, i do.
	<br>
	<br>	I know girlsilike you.
	<br>
	<br>	You act like money's not important.
	<br>
	<br>	The truth is, money's important to everyone.
	<br>
	<br>	And i thought blair was manipulative.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair's an amateur.
	<br>
	<br>	She thinks you're just like her.
	<br>
	<br>	To blair, this money is a couple pairs
	<br>	of manolos and a chanel bag
	<br>
	<br>	But i know that this much cash can
	<br>	make a real difference in your life
	<br>
	<br>	You're sick
	<br>
	<br>	You're welcome
	<br>
	<br>	Who knew b and c
	<br>	were such patrons of the arts
	<br>
	<br>	Call it philanthropy or bribery
	<br>
	<br>	It looks like everyone has their price
	<br>
	<br>	Something on your mind, lily
	<br>
	<br>	Uh...
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah
	<br>
	<br>	What are you saying
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry. It's sheldon
	<br>
	<br>	He has those numbers i was asking for
	<br>
	<br>	Do you mind
	<br>
	<br>	No
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah
	<br>
	<br>	Just make sure he gets it at the current rate
	<br>
	<br>	The dollar's been all over the place
	<br>
	<br>	Hello
	<br>
	<br>	I was thinking about what you said
	<br>
	<br>	Let's do it
	<br>
	<br>	Let's see what we are
	<br>	Let's see what we could be
	<br>
	<br>	Who is this
	<br>
	<br>	Rufus...
	<br>
	<br>	Lily, this is great
	<br>
	<br>	Do you know how great this is
	<br>
	<br>	Well, yes. I mean, I-I do
	<br>
	<br>	I mean, i think so
	<br>
	<br>	Let's go away tonight
	<br>
	<br>	Let's pack a bag
	<br>
	<br>	Let's get away from everyone everything
	<br>
	<br>	just figure it out
	<br>
	<br>	Wh-where would we go
	<br>
	<br>	Who cares
	<br>
	<br>	Okay, sounds like a plan
	<br>
	<br>	Um...
	<br>
	<br>	90th and 5th
	<br>
	<br>	6:00
	<br>
	<br>	Okay
	<br>
	<br>	I'm scared, rufus...
	<br>
	<br>	In a good way
	<br>
	<br>	Me, too
	<br>
	<br>	Settle down, please
	<br>
	<br>	Yesterday
	<br>
	<br>	I talked about the serious consequences...
	<br>	- Proof
	<br>	- Worth every penny
	<br>
	<br>	For your dishonorable actions
	<br>
	<br>	and obviously, you didn't believe me.
	<br>
	<br>	But someone came forward today
	<br>
	<br>	and claimed responsibility...
	<br>
	<br>	Do you know who?
	<br>
	<br>	For a crime he did not commit.
	<br>
	<br>	And although i appreciate his self-sacrifice
	<br>
	<br>	I don't abide dishonesty
	<br>
	<br>	And I think it's time you
	<br>	all know how serious I am
	<br>
	<br>	Nathaniel archibald is
	<br>	suspended from st Jude's
	<br>
	<br>	And, yes, this will go on his transcript
	<br>
	<br>	Effective immediately.
	<br>
	<br>	Mr. Archibald
	<br>
	<br>	you know where to find the exit.
	<br>
	<br>	This just in
	<br>
	<br>	nate archibald, dead man walking
	<br>
	<br>	We hear st Jude's has a new policy
	<br>
	<br>	an eye for a lie.
	<br>
	<br>	Watch him go, students.
	<br>
	<br>	Who wants to be next?
	<br>
	<br>	Until one of you comes forward
	<br>	we'll keep going
	<br>
	<br>	until every last one of you
	<br>	has walked out that door
	<br>
	<br>	I don't believe this.
	<br>
	<br>	Dan, it's okay.
	<br>
	<br>	Serena, i-i can't-- i can't get expelled
	<br>	I cannot get suspended
	<br>
	<br>	My whole future is riding on this.
	<br>
	<br>	If you know who broke in
	<br>	then why won't you give them up
	<br>
	<br>	Because it was me.
	<br>
	<br>	So why
	<br>	why didn't you tell me right away?
	<br>
	<br>	'Cause i didn't want you to judge me
	<br>
	<br>	And i didn't want you to know
	<br>
	<br>	because i didn't want you to have
	<br>	to be in the position you're in now
	<br>
	<br>	of having to choose between
	<br>	protecting me and helping yourself
	<br>
	<br>	So how'd you even get in
	<br>
	<br>	I have a key
	<br>
	<br>	You had a key to the pool?
	<br>
	<br>	All right
	<br>
	<br>	what happened to being beyond this
	<br>
	<br>	Sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	The end of freshman year
	<br>
	<br>	I kind of dated the swim team captain
	<br>
	<br>	and he gave me a key so that we could...
	<br>
	<br>	You know, meet up, and...
	<br>
	<br>	That's--enough said.
	<br>
	<br>	And saturday night-- what happened then?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, blair and i ran out of places to go
	<br>
	<br>	and she knew i still had a key, and...
	<br>
	<br>	Before i knew it, it's like we were all there.
	<br>
	<br>	And i thought it was just gonna be us girls.
	<br>
	<br>	And then everybody got on their phone
	<br>
	<br>	and more people started showing up
	<br>	and...
	<br>
	<br>	I just never thought anybody
	<br>	was gonna get hurt
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, you can still tell queller the truth
	<br>	I think she'll respect your honesty
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, like she respected nate's?
	<br>
	<br>	No, nate lied.
	<br>
	<br>	And besides, you're serena van der woodsen.
	<br>
	<br>	You didn't know me before i went away.
	<br>
	<br>	Barely got back into constance.
	<br>
	<br>	If i got expelled, I don't think any
	<br>	school in town would take me.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sure that's not true.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't risk going back to boarding school
	<br>
	<br>	being away from you and eric
	<br>
	<br>	But i don't want you to lose your future
	<br>
	<br>	Wow
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, wow
	<br>
	<br>	You really can be damned if
	<br>	you do and screwed if you don't
	<br>
	<br>	Dan humphrey
	<br>
	<br>	headmistress queller is requesting
	<br>	to see y u iher office after class
	<br>
	<br>	Nate
	<br>
	<br>	Hey. Are you okay
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, i'll be fine
	<br>
	<br>	It's, uh...
	<br>
	<br>	My parents have so much other
	<br>	stuff going on right now...
	<br>
	<br>	They'll get over it
	<br>
	<br>	Either way, it was worth it
	<br>
	<br>	Worth it
	<br>
	<br>	Yes. Blair
	<br>
	<br>	I know how much your future means to you
	<br>
	<br>	And you've worked so hard
	<br>	for yale and everything
	<br>
	<br>	what are you talking about
	<br>
	<br>	You don't have to lie
	<br>
	<br>	I saw the key in your bedroom
	<br>
	<br>	That key isn't mine
	<br>
	<br>	I was st hiding it for someone else
	<br>
	<br>	Wait...
	<br>
	<br>	That's why you were suspended
	<br>
	<br>	You told the headmistress it was yours
	<br>
	<br>	because you thought it was mine
	<br>
	<br>	That's the most romantic thing
	<br>	anyone has ever done for me
	<br>
	<br>	I love you
	<br>
	<br>	Please
	<br>
	<br>	You and i just can't happen right now
	<br>
	<br>	Why not
	<br>
	<br>	I don't want to be with you
	<br>
	<br>	Good catching up
	<br>
	<br>	You're home early
	<br>
	<br>	Please don't tell me you're expelled
	<br>	- Not yet
	<br>
	<br>	Your position at that school
	<br>	is already too precarious
	<br>
	<br>	One false move, and you know what
	<br>
	<br>	I can't do anything to help you
	<br>
	<br>	I know. I know
	<br>
	<br>	I just wanna hide under the
	<br>	covers and make it all go away
	<br>
	<br>	And apparently, you do, too
	<br>
	<br>	You and bart just got back
	<br>	Why are you packing again
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i was just gonna go for a
	<br>
	<br>	you know
	<br>	a little spa trip for the weekend
	<br>
	<br>	'Cause you're so stressed
	<br>	out from your vacation
	<br>
	<br>	Aren't you gonna answer that?
	<br>
	<br>	No, i don't think so
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, is dan's dad the reason you
	<br>	haven't answered bart's proposal
	<br>
	<br>	You can't
	<br>
	<br>	Please, mom, not this one
	<br>
	<br>	Look, i will not base my personal life
	<br>	on your preferences.
	<br>
	<br>	Dan is my boyfriend
	<br>
	<br>	And i know we're too
	<br>	young to talk about forever
	<br>
	<br>	but right now that's what it feels like
	<br>
	<br>	I know it does, sweetie, but
	<br>	- but what
	<br>
	<br>	Tell me that rufus is that important to you
	<br>
	<br>	Tell me that whatever the two of you have
	<br>
	<br>	is the most important thing in your life
	<br>
	<br>	because that's what dan is to me, mom
	<br>
	<br>	The most important
	<br>
	<br>	I would rather be chuck's stepsister
	<br>	than dan's.
	<br>
	<br>	Please don't do this to me
	<br>
	<br>	Dan means that much to you
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, he does
	<br>
	<br>	In fact, i have to go
	<br>
	<br>	Wait. Where
	<br>
	<br>	School
	<br>
	<br>	There's something i have to do
	<br>
	<br>	And i hope there's something
	<br>	you have to do, too
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing here
	<br>
	<br>	I brought this for you
	<br>
	<br>	What's the catch
	<br>
	<br>	I know this might come as a shock
	<br>
	<br>	but not everyone operates from an agenda
	<br>
	<br>	In fact, some people do things
	<br>
	<br>	simply because it's the decent thing to do
	<br>
	<br>	Smash it, burn it, whatever
	<br>
	<br>	There are no copies
	<br>
	<br>	What about the one you gave to chuck
	<br>
	<br>	It's blank
	<br>
	<br>	which i'm sure he'll be thrilled to discover
	<br>
	<br>	And about what's on that tape
	<br>
	<br>	having observed you in your natural
	<br>	habitat these past few days...
	<br>
	<br>	Nate seems like one of the good guys
	<br>
	<br>	and you seem to really care about him
	<br>
	<br>	Mr. Humphrey
	<br>
	<br>	you have a partial scholarship at st
	<br>	Jude's
	<br>
	<br>	You are number two in your class
	<br>
	<br>	have a stellar recommendation
	<br>	for dartmouth from j. L. Hall.
	<br>
	<br>	It looks as if your dreams
	<br>	are well within grasp
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you, thank you
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, i guess they are
	<br>
	<br>	But it seems you're in
	<br>	with a n crowd this year
	<br>
	<br>	dating serena van der woodsen...
	<br>
	<br>	Is that on my file
	<br>
	<br>	Who had the key to the school
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know
	<br>
	<br>	Let me remind you one last time
	<br>
	<br>	that you are in a different
	<br>	position than the others
	<br>
	<br>	You need this school
	<br>
	<br>	Headmistress queller
	<br>	i have something to tell you
	<br>
	<br>	I must say
	<br>	your file reads more like a rap sheet
	<br>
	<br>	You cut more sophomore
	<br>	classes than you attended
	<br>
	<br>	cheated on tests
	<br>
	<br>	talked back to teachers
	<br>
	<br>	Look, I understand that
	<br>	this is a serious matter
	<br>
	<br>	That's why it's important to me that
	<br>
	<br>	you know
	<br>
	<br>	you being new here
	<br>
	<br>	that the person that you just
	<br>	described is not w i am anymore
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, no
	<br>
	<br>	Who are you now
	<br>
	<br>	Well, my grades are up
	<br>
	<br>	my attendance is nearly perfect
	<br>
	<br>	and i've stayed out of trouble
	<br>
	<br>	Until now
	<br>
	<br>	Please understand
	<br>
	<br>	that i never intended for
	<br>	anything bad to happen
	<br>
	<br>	And it may have taken some time
	<br>
	<br>	but i am here now
	<br>
	<br>	accepting responsibility for my actions
	<br>
	<br>	Whatever you think is fair
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, let's discuss the...
	<br>
	<br>	Consequences
	<br>
	<br>	* breakfast in new york *
	<br>
	<br>	* and i know that we're dreaming *
	<br>
	<br>	* drunken conversations and
	<br>	things we were screaming *
	<br>
	<br>	I'll be brief
	<br>
	<br>	And...
	<br>
	<br>	I'll be not interested
	<br>
	<br>	Is that how you speak to the person
	<br>	who just paid your rent for a year
	<br>
	<br>	What did you just say
	<br>
	<br>	Congratulations, vanessa
	<br>
	<br>	You just won 365 more days
	<br>	in your ikea-furnished closet
	<br>
	<br>	You went to my building
	<br>
	<br>	You talked to my landlord
	<br>
	<br>	No, i don't speak ukrainian
	<br>	but i do speak envelope of cash
	<br>
	<br>	And he understood me perfectly
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe you
	<br>
	<br>	Blair waldorf is not indebted to anyone
	<br>
	<br>	no matter how much i appreciate what you did
	<br>
	<br>	You're welcome, i guess
	<br>
	<br>	Good
	<br>
	<br>	Now this transaction is finished
	<br>
	<br>	and i'm free to return to disliking you
	<br>
	<br>	I wouldn't have it any other way
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, and one more thing
	<br>
	<br>	If you didn't pay your rent with it
	<br>
	<br>	what did you do with chuck's money
	<br>
	<br>	I may have created a medical grant
	<br>	for teens with genital herpes...
	<br>
	<br>	In his name
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe she didn't expel me
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, i know
	<br>
	<br>	It's shocking
	<br>
	<br>	I--you--25 hours of community outreach
	<br>
	<br>	That's not bad at all
	<br>
	<br>	I mean, i probably would've done it
	<br>	anyway being as i'm on the committee
	<br>
	<br>	That had occurred to me
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah
	<br>
	<br>	Wait. What are you saying
	<br>
	<br>	No, no, i'm not saying anything
	<br>
	<br>	Believe me
	<br>
	<br>	So you don't buy
	<br>
	<br>	what she said about me being
	<br>
	<br>	the poster child for the new honor code
	<br>
	<br>	Look, I know
	<br>
	<br>	for a fact my mom didn't plead my case
	<br>
	<br>	or donate anything, okay
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't say a thing
	<br>
	<br>	Are you really turning this into
	<br>	an "upstairs, downstairs" thing
	<br>
	<br>	No. No, you are
	<br>
	<br>	I'm being completely silent
	<br>
	<br>	I'm just happy that you're not being expelled
	<br>
	<br>	or leaving town anytime soon
	<br>	Are you hungry
	<br>
	<br>	We should...
	<br>
	<br>	Always
	<br>
	<br>	But you still believe that
	<br>	there's a double standard
	<br>
	<br>	that people like me get specl trtrtment
	<br>
	<br>	Ms. Van der woodsen
	<br>
	<br>	Your mother sent me to pick you up
	<br>
	<br>	Oh
	<br>
	<br>	Great
	<br>
	<br>	That was...
	<br>
	<br>	Thoughtful
	<br>
	<br>	I think you get no special treatment at all
	<br>
	<br>	Your life is completely uncharmed and...
	<br>
	<br>	Average
	<br>
	<br>	It's okay. I'll walk
	<br>
	<br>	No, come on
	<br>	I'm--i was kidding
	<br>
	<br>	I was kidding
	<br>
	<br>	You going to brooklyn
	<br>
	<br>	It's a rare occasion to celebr
	<br>	ate the merging of two families
	<br>
	<br>	And i couldn't be happier
	<br>
	<br>	to be here tonight to celebrate
	<br>	lily's acceptance of my proposal
	<br>
	<br>	* forgive me if i'm young *
	<br>
	<br>	* for speaking out of turn *
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>	* trying to make it right *

	<br>
	<br>	Mom looks about as happy
	<br>	as grandma at last call
	<br>
	<br>	I know
	<br>
	<br>	It seems bart's personality
	<br>
	<br>	or lack thereof--is contagious
	<br>
	<br>	I don't even know how she breathes
	<br>	with her blouse buttoned that high
	<br>
	<br>	How glad are you to see
	<br>	our families merge, sis
	<br>
	<br>	So glad that if you ever call me that again
	<br>
	<br>	it'll be the last thing you ever say, chuck
	<br>
	<br>	I love it
	<br>
	<br>	our first brother/sister squabble
	<br>
	<br>	I hope you're going to
	<br>
	<br>	make yourself available for more
	<br>
	<br>	missed childhood memories
	<br>
	<br>	bathing together, for example
	<br>
	<br>	(dvor?k's "romantic pieces opus 75" playing you're
	<br>	probably wondering why i asked you here.
	<br>
	<br>	After our last conversation, yeah
	<br>
	<br>	Do you think it's possible for two people
	<br>
	<br>	who have been through as much as we have to
	<br>
	<br>	really forgive and forget
	<br>
	<br>	If we really want to, i think we can
	<br>
	<br>	A lot of mistakes have been made
	<br>
	<br>	If you're ready to forgive me...
	<br>
	<br>	Then nothing can tear us apart
	<br>
	<br>	I promise
	<br>
	<br>	What you said before...
	<br>
	<br>	I love you, too
	<br>
	<br>	Always have, always will
	<br>
	<br>	So...
	<br>
	<br>	Your new stepbrother told me
	<br>	about your problem at school
	<br>
	<br>	Frankly, i wasn't surprised
	<br>
	<br>	given your propensity for
	<br>	recklessness and adventure
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry
	<br>
	<br>	Don't tell your mother
	<br>
	<br>	but i made a call
	<br>
	<br>	You did what
	<br>
	<br>	It was harder than usual
	<br>
	<br>	That new headmistress of
	<br>	yours is a real piece of work
	<br>
	<br>	I had to go over her head
	<br>
	<br>	Sorry i couldn't get the charges
	<br>	completely dropped
	<br>
	<br>	but, um...
	<br>
	<br>	At least i got you a minimal sentence
	<br>
	<br>	One thing about being on the inside
	<br>
	<br>	once you get there, you don't always
	<br>	get to choose where you stand...
	<br>
	<br>	Or sit
	<br>
	<br>	I was just looking out for my family
	<br>
	<br>	The new van der woodsen/bass
	<br>
	<br>	library should be completed
	<br>	for eric's graduation
	<br>
	<br>	I can see that lily
	<br>
	<br>	and i are gonna have our hands full with
	<br>
	<br>	- the two of you.
	<br>	- Will you excuse me? I need some air
	<br>
	<br>	Sometimes you need to step outside
	<br>
	<br>	clear your head and remind
	<br>	yourself of who you are...
	<br>
	<br>	And where you want to be
	<br>
	<br>	* i left as soon as i was strong *
	<br>
	<br>	Hey
	<br>
	<br>	Aren't you supposed to be at
	<br>	your mom's engagement thing
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, well, i had to get out of there.
	<br>
	<br>	It was getting a little hard to breathe
	<br>	you know?
	<br>
	<br>	Those parties can be that way.
	<br>
	<br>	So are you, um, packing up your music
	<br>
	<br>	Nah. I just...
	<br>
	<br>	Need to find something new to write about
	<br>
	<br>	And i will
	<br>
	<br>	* cross the river to the other side *
	<br>
	<br>	* cross the river to the other side *
	<br>
	<br>	Hey
	<br>
	<br>	You're a little overdressed for the
	<br>	study date i didn't know we had.
	<br>
	<br>	You were right about everything.
	<br>
	<br>	You wanna talk about it?
	<br>
	<br>	* home again *
	<br>
	<br>	* or else you'll give it one more try *
	<br>
	<br>	Can i just sit here with you for a while
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	* or risk it all to satisfy *
	<br>
	<br>	Chaucer?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, i got a test on friday
	<br>
	<br>	Mine's thursday
	<br>
	<br>	* to cross the river to the other side *
	<br>
	<br>	* cross the river to the other side *
	<br>	And sometimes you have
	<br>
	<br>	to venture outside your world
	<br>	in order to find yourself
	<br>
	<br>	As for me
	<br>
	<br>	I'm happy right where I am
	<br>
	<br>	I only wanna be with you
