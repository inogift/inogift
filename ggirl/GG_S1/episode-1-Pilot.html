<br>	OH, I'M JUST SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
<br>
<br>	MUST BE A LOT OF RUMORS WHY YOU'RE BACK.
<br>
<br>	YEAH, BUT NONE OF THEM MENTION YOU.
<br>
<br>	JUST LIKE MOM WANTS, HUH?WHAT DO I WANT, BABY?
<br>
<br>	FOR SERENA TO SLEEP IN HER OWN BED, POSSIBLY WEARING PAJAMAS.
<br>
<br>	MORNING, MOM.
<br>

<br>
<br>	IF I COULD TAKE ERIC TO BREAKFAST. WANNA COME?
<br>
<br>	UM... NO.
<br>
<br>	I THINK WHAT I'LL DO IS GO GET HIM A CROISSANT DOWN THE STREET.
<br>
<br>	SERENA, DON'T.
<br>
<br>	LET ME GUESS--YOU TOLD EVERYONE
<br>
<br>	ERIC'S JUST VISITING GRANDPA IN RHODE ISLAND.YOUR AUNT CAROL IN MIAMI.
<br>
<br>	SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY HIDING HIM?HE TRIES TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE,
<br>
<br>	-AND YOU'RE WORRIED IT'S GONNA COST YOU "MOM OF THE YEAR"?
<br>	-SERENA, YOU'VE BEEN GONE,
<br>
<br>	DOING WHO KNOWS WHAT WITH GOD KNOWS WHO--
<br>
<br>	I TOLD YOU, BOARDING SCHOOL WAS NOT LIKE THAT.THEN YOU KNOW WHAT?
<br>
<br>	AS HAPPY AS I AM TO HAVE YOU HOME,
<br>
<br>	YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S BEEN LIKE.
<br>
<br>	GUESS WHOSE DAD IS COOL?
<br>
<br>	IT'S A TRICK QUESTION.YEAH, 'CAUSE IT CAN'T BE OURS.
<br>
<br>	HA HA, HA HA. LOOK AT THIS.
<br>
<br>	"TOP TEN FORGOTTEN BANDS OF THE '90s."

<br>	YEAH, CHECK OUT WHO'S NUMBER NINE.
<br>
<br>	HE'S VERY PROUD.MM-HMM.
<br>
<br>	HEY! HEY, WAY TO BE FORGOTTEN.BUT THAT'S HOW YOU GET REMEMBERED.
<br>
<br>	MAYBE YOU'D CARE IF DAD'S BAND WAS ON "GOSSIP GIRL."

<br>
<br>	THAT'S--THAT'S FOR CHICKS.SO THAT WASN'T YOUR LAPTOP OPEN TO IT LAST NIGHT

<br>	WELL, NO OFFENSE IF I SOUND SURPRISED
<br>
<br>	SINCE I'VE NEVER BEEN INVITED.ONE OF THE GIRLS IN MY ART CLASS SAW MY CALLIGRAPHY,
<br>
<br>	AND SHE SAID THAT IF I ADDRESSED ALL THE INVITATIONS
<br>
<br>	THAT I COULD HAVE ONE.SOUNDS VERY FAIR. THE SWEATSHOPS COULD LEARN A THING OR TWO.
<br>
<br>	DAD, THIS IS NOT A PLATFORM
<br>
<br>	FOR ONE OF YOUR ANTICAPITALIST RANTS.YES, IT IS.
<br>
<br>	BESIDES, YOU MAKE US GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOL.THAT'S FOR YOUR EDUCATION.
<br>
<br>	SO WE SHOULD JUST BE ANONYMOUS LOSERS WHO EAT LUNCH ALONE
<br>
<br>	-AND NEVER GET INVITED TO PARTIES?
<br>	-WORKS FOR ME.
<br>
<br>	MOM THINKS IT'S A GOOD IDEA.AND HER JUDGMENT IS ALWAYS SOUND, RIGHT?
<br>
<br>	JENNY, YOU WANNA GO TO THAT PARTY, YOU SHOULD GO.
<br>
<br>	YOU KIDS COULD USE SOME FUN.
<br>
<br>	NATE?

<br>
<br>	YEAH, UH,WE'RE RENOVATING AGAIN.
<br>
<br>	YOU KNOW MY MOM--IF IT'S NOT BROKE, BREAK IT.
<br>
<br>	SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

<br>
<br>	HEY,WATCH WHERE YORE GNG!
<br>
<br>	SERENA LOOKED EFFING HOT LAST NIGHT.
<br>
<br>	THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT LEVEL OF PERFECTION.
<br>
<br>	IT NEEDS TO BE VIOLATED.
<br>
<br>	YOU'RE TELLING ME IF YOU HAD THE CHANCE--I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
<br>
<br>	YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DATING SINCE KINDERGARTEN
<br>
<br>	AND YOU HAVEN'T SEALED THE DEAL.
<br>
<br>	WHO SAYS, "SEAL THE DEAL"?
<br>
<br>	COME ON.
<br>
<br>	ARE YOU FOLLOWING US OR SOMETHING?
<br>
<br>	NO, I-I GO TO YOUR SCHOOL.
<br>
<br>	IDENTICAL UNIFORMS?IS THAT KIND OF A TIP-OFF?
<br>
<br>	THAT'S FUNNY.
<br>
<br>	SO YOU GUYS WANNA SIT TOGETHER AT LUNCH?
<br>
<br>	SO CUTE! THESE SHOULD BE FRAMED OR SOMETHING.
<br>
<br>	NOT BAD WORK.
<br>

<br>
<br>	WHEN'S THE PARTY?
<br>
<br>	SATURDAY.
<br>
<br>	AND...YOU'RE KINDA NOT INVITED...
<br>
<br>	SINCE UNTIL 12 HOURS AGO,
<br>
<br>	EVERYONE THOUGHT YOU WERE AT BOARDING SCHOOL.
<br>
<br>	NOW WE'RE FULL, AND, UH,JENNY USED UP ALL THE INVITES.
<br>
<br>	UM, ACTUALLY--YOU CAN GO NOW.

<br>
<br>	I GOT A LOT OF STUFF TO DO ANYWAY.
<br>
<br>	WELL,WE SHOULD GET GOING THEN.
<br>
<br>	UNLESS YOU WANT US TO WAIT FOR YOU.
<br>
<br>	LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT A LOT OF YOGURT LEFT.NO, GO AHEAD.

<br>	BLAIR,THINK WE COULD MEET TONIGHT?
<br>
<br>	I'D LOVE TO,

<br>	BUT I'M DOING SOMETHING WITH NATE TONIGHT.
<br>
<br>	THE PALACE. 8:00?
<br>
<br>	NATE WILL WAIT.SPOTTED ON THE STEPS OF THE MET--
<br>
<br>	AN S. AND B. POWER STRUGGLE.
<br>
<br>	I COULD PROBABLY DO A HALF-HOUR.
<br>
<br>	DID S. THINK SHE COULD WALTZ HOME,
<br>
<br>	AND THINGS WOULD BE JUST LIKE THEY WERE?
<br>	-THANKS FOR MAKING THE TIME.
<br>
<br>	YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.
<br>
<br>	DID B. THINK S.WOULD GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT?
<br>
<br>	OR CAN THESE TWO HOTTIES WORK IT OUT?
<br>
<br>	THERE'S NOTHING GOSSIP GIR
<br>
<br>	THAN A GOOD CATFIGHT,
<br>
<br>	AND THIS COULD BE A CLASSIC.
<br>
<br>	UH, YOU KNOW--YOU KNOW, DAD,

<br>
<br>	N WHERYOU CAPOST ALL THIS INFORMATION ONLINE.

<br>
<br>	MAYBE IF MUSICIANS GOT OFF THEIR BLOGS
<br>
<br>	AND PICKED UP THEIR GUITARS,
<br>
<br>	THE MUSIC BUSINESS WOULD BE IN BETTER SHAPE.
<br>
<br>	-SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE RELIC.

<br>
<br>	HEY, DAD, LISTEN, UM, I GOTTA RUN. ARE YOU GONNA BE OKAY?
<br>
<br>	YEAH. YEAH,YOUR MOM WILL BE BACK.
<br>
<br>	SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN A FREE SPIRIT.
<br>
<br>	THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I FELL FOR HER IN THE FIRST PLACE.
<br>

<br>
<br>	NATHANIEL, YOU'RE FINALLY ABOUT TO HAVE SEX
<br>
<br>	WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
<br>
<br>	IT'S LIKE YOU'RE HEADED TO YOUR EXECUTION.
<br>
<br>	NO, MAN, I'M GOOD.
<br>
<br>	TALK TO CHUCK, BUDDY.
<br>
<br>	YOU AND BLAIR HAVE BEEN DATING FOREVER.
<br>
<br>	-ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S A PROBLEM?
<br>	-THERE'S NO PROBLEM.
<br>
<br>	IT'S JUST...
<br>
<br>	DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE
<br>
<br>	OUR WHOLE LIVES HAVE BEEN PLANNED OUT FOR US,
<br>
<br>	THAT WE'RE JUST GONNA END UP LIKE OUR PARENTS?
<br>
<br>	MAN, THAT'S A DARK THOUGHT.
<br>
<br>	AND AREN'T WE ENTITLED TO CHOOSE, JUST TO BE HAPPY?LOOK, EASY, SOCRATES.
<br>
<br>	WHAT WE'RE ENTITLED TO IS A TRUST FUND,
<br>
<br>	MAYBE A HOUSE IN THE HAMPTONS,A PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROBLEM.
<br>
<br>	BUT HAPPINESS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ON THE MENU,
<br>
<br>	SO SMOKE UP AND SEAL THE DEAL WITH BLAIR,
<br>
<br>	'CAUSE YOU'RE ALSO ENTITLED TO TAP THAT ASS.
<br>
<br>	SO HOW'S YOUR MOM DOING WITH THE DIVORCE AND EVERYTHING?
<br>
<br>	GREAT.
<br>
<br>	SO MY DAD LEFT HER FOR ANOTHER MAN.
<br>
<br>	SHE LOST 15 POUNDS,GOT AN EYE LIFT.
<br>
<br>	-IT'S BEEN GOOD FOR HER.
<br>	-I'M REALLY SORRY.
<br>
<br>	YEAH, I COULD TELL,SINCE YOU DIDN'T CALL OR WRITE
<br>
<br>	THE ENTIRE TIME IT WAS HAPPENING.
<br>
<br>	NO, I-I KNOW, I WAS JUST--BOARDING SCHOOL IS LIKE--I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
<br>
<br>	YOU WENT TO BOARDING SCHOOL TO BEING WITH.
<br>
<br>	DO YOU KNOW HOW IT FELT
<br>
<br>	CALLING YOUR HOUSE WHEN YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP AT SCHOOL
<br>
<br>	AND HAVING YOUR MOM SAY,"SERENA DIDN'T TELL YOU
<br>
<br>	THAT SHE MOVED TO CONNECTICUT?"
<br>
<br>	I JUST...I-I HAD TO GO. I JUST--
<br>
<br>	I NEEDED TO GET AWAY FROM EVERYTHING.
<br>
<br>	PLEASE, JUST TRUST ME.
<br>
<br>	HOW CAN I TRUST YOU WHEN I FEEL LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU?
<br>
<br>	LET'S FIX THAT.
<br>
<br>	I SAW YOU AT SCHOOL WITH--WITH KATY AND IS,
<br>
<br>	AND I-I GET IT.
<br>
<br>	I-I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY OF THAT AWAY FROM YOU--
<br>
<br>	BECAUSE IT'S JUST YOURS TO TAKE IF YOU WANT IT.
<br>
<br>	NO, THAT--THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN. I...

<br>	I MISS YOU.
<br>
<br>	I JUST WANT THINGS TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THEY USED TO BE--

<br>	WE NEED EACH OTHER.
<br>
<br>	WELL...
