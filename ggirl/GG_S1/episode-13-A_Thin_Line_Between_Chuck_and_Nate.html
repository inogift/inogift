<h1>Gossip Girl Season 1 - 13 - A THIN LINE BETWEEN CHUCK AND NATE    </h1>



<div class="full-script">
	<br>	Gossip girl here.
	<br>
	<br>	Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
	<br>
	<br>	I know who blair and those girls are,
	<br>
	<br>	But I know who I am, and I'm not gonna forget that
	<br>
	<br>	Just 'cause I hang out with them.
	<br>
	<br>	The previously mentioned excited artist is my wife.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought you said the artist lived in hudson.
	<br>
	<br>	If the trains ever stop running. he proposed before we left,
	<br>
	<br>	And I'm going to say yes. take care, rufus.
	<br>
	<br>	Unless you want dear nathaniel to know how
	<br>
	<br>	You lost your virginity to me in the back of a moving vehicle,
	<br>
	<br>	I encourage patience and restraint.
	<br>
	<br>	If you're ready to forgive me, nothing can tear us apart.
	<br>
	<br>	I love you, nate archibald.
	<br>
	<br>	Are we really gonna do this? yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	Do you like me? define "like."
	<br>
	<br>	What's the difference between gossip and scandal?
	<br>
	<br>	So glad you asked, ues forever.
	<br>
	<br>	Anyone can commit a minor indiscretion
	<br>
	<br>	And generate a day's worth of buzz,
	<br>
	<br>	But in order for gossip to birth a true scandal,
	<br>
	<br>	It requires the right person to be in the wrong place.
	<br>
	<br>	Take one "it" girl on a pedestal.
	<br>
	<br>	Which one do you recommend?
	<br>
	<br>	Add a crowd eager to see her fall
	<br>
	<br>	And give them the means to knock her down.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe this. oh, my god.
	<br>
	<br>	Dan!
	<br>
	<br>	What? what? what? you okay? no.
	<br>
	<br>	I'fine.euh, I was just testing my screaming
	<br>
	<br>	To see its screaming efficiency. well, dad,
	<br>
	<br>	Now I'd like to kill her, please. what are you hiding?
	<br>
	<br>	Nothing, dad, stop. you're invading my privacy. this is a loft.
	<br>
	<br>	No, stop. you guys.
	<br>
	<br>	Dan, you're gonna be really sorry you did that.
	<br>
	<br>	Jenny, would you excuse us?
	<br>
	<br>	Is there something you want to tell me?
	<br>
	<br>	Am I that obvious? yes, actually.
	<br>
	<br>	That hair color is all wrong for you.
	<br>
	<br>	That's funny.
	<br>
	<br>	This isn't.
	<br>
	<br>	Please say something.
	<br>
	<br>	A-anything would be better than this
	<br>
	<br>	"i am so disappointed in you" silence.
	<br>
	<br>	Since the time you could walk,
	<br>
	<br>	Your mother and i-- we knew you were special.
	<br>
	<br>	You were very art, very talented,
	<br>
	<br>	And we promised each other we would do whatever it took
	<br>
	<br>	To give you a bright future,
	<br>
	<br>	And that did not include you becoming a teenage father.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad, this wasn't seriously, not a part of the plan,
	<br>
	<br>	But whatever serena decides to do,
	<br>
	<br>	I-i-i want to be there for her.
	<br>
	<br>	I-i have to be there for her.
	<br>
	<br>	I love her.
	<br>
	<br>	Dan... I do.
	<br>
	<br>	I do, whether she's pregnant, whether she's not pregnant...
	<br>
	<br>	I-i love her.
	<br>
	<br>	First things first. I think you need to talk to her.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe it's not even true. did you hear what I just said?
	<br>
	<br>	I heard you, and I hope you heard what I said.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, mom.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, I'm pregnant, and it's yours.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey. I've been calling you every two seconds for the past hour.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, I left my cell at home. i-i kinda had a lot on my mind.
	<br>
	<br>	I know, and I'm--i'm sorry--
	<br>
	<br>	No, wait, wait, wait. me first.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry that you didn't feel that you could tell me,
	<br>
	<br>	And no matter what you decide, I want you to know
	<br>
	<br>	That I'm here for you because i-i-i--because I love you. dan,
	<br>
	<br>	So you don't have to say that. I mean, you don't have to,
	<br>
	<br>	Because, um, I get it. you would have done the right thing.
	<br>
	<br>	Um, thank you, though. that-- that's--that's really sweet. yeah, yeah,
	<br>
	<br>	Well, hey, that's good news-- the no baby part.
	<br>
	<br>	It's really good news, like my-dad's-probably-gonna-
	<br>
	<br>	Throw-a-party-good news. your dad? look, can we actually talk later?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm late to meet blair. she's on the steps of the met.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, yeah, no, go. go, go. it can wait,
	<br>
	<br>	Unlike blair, who's waiting on the steps, right? exactly. yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay, I'll talk to you later. okay, all right.
	<br>
	<br>	Her new line was fabulous.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi!
	<br>
	<br>	Jenny, hi. you're late.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, I know. I had to drop some books off at the library. sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	Would you do me a favor? anything.
	<br>
	<br>	Move down a couple steps.
	<br>
	<br>	You know, this whole hazing thing is getting a bit old,
	<br>
	<br>	Don't you think, b.? first of all, the hazing stops when I say it stops.
	<br>
	<br>	And for future reference, only my friends call me "b."
	<br>
	<br>	You know, I'm actually gonna go.
	<br>
	<br>	I have a lot of stuff to do before class. jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	Please, she'll be back.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, you.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, guys. hey.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not pregnant.
	<br>
	<br>	Aw, cool. congratulations.
	<br>
	<br>	Celebratory drinks after school?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, sure. blair, can I talk to you?
	<br>
	<br>	Of course.
	<br>
	<br>	Excuse me.
	<br>
	<br>	Did you get my text? of course. yes, I did, but I've been--
	<br>
	<br>	So then you know I told dan I'm not pregnant.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, and I am so happy for you. close call, huh?
	<br>
	<br>	Are we really gonna play that old game, b.?
	<br>
	<br>	I have no idea what you're talking about.
	<br>
	<br>	Whenever something happens that's not a part of your plan,
	<br>
	<br>	You pretend like it doesn't exist.
	<br>
	<br>	You act like you're in this movie about your perfect life,
	<br>
	<br>	Then I have to remind you,
	<br>
	<br>	The only one watching that movie is you.
	<br>
	<br>	You admitted that your period was late. yes, I've been very stressed.
	<br>
	<br>	And you're acting like a total bitch
	<br>
	<br>	Because you're not hormonal? maybe I am a total bitch.
	<br>
	<br>	Just take the test, b.
	<br>
	<br>	Stop it.
	<br>
	<br>	Just take the test.
	<br>
	<br>	You need to know if you and chuck are gonna have a baby.
	<br>
	<br>	And for a scandal to really blow up,
	<br>
	<br>	All it needs is an unexpected turn.
	<br>
	<br>	Would you do me a really big favor?
	<br>
	<br>	What is it, sweetie?
	<br>
	<br>	I need you to come with me to visit my dad in rehab.
	<br>
	<br>	Please.
	<br>
	<br>	Really?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, it's just--
	<br>
	<br>	It gets really awaward when I have to go alone now,
	<br>
	<br>	And I don't know what to say anymore.
	<br>
	<br>	He loves you. you always know how to make him laugh.
	<br>
	<br>	Nathaniel archibald,
	<br>
	<br>	You have never asked me for anything,
	<br>
	<br>	And here you are, officially leaning on me.
	<br>
	<br>	This time we're gonna be so much better together.
	<br>
	<br>	We already are.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, at least now you know. know what? that I've wasted half the year
	<br>
	<br>	Trying to be friends with someone
	<br>
	<br>	That's never going to like me? uh, yeah. that's exactly it.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey. guys. so...
	<br>
	<br>	Dad.
	<br>
	<br>	You're not gonna be a grandfather.
	<br>
	<br>	That's cool.
	<br>
	<br>	That's really cool.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, yes, yes.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes!
	<br>
	<br>	Yes.
	<br>
	<br>	And I thought I was relieved. it's not all good news, though.
	<br>
	<br>	I-i told her I love her, and she thinks I only said that
	<br>
	<br>	Because I thought she was pregnant. well, son,
	<br>
	<br>	Gives you a minute to step back and enjoy being 17.
	<br>
	<br>	You two were moving a bit too fast anyway.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm late for the gallery, but we can talk more later.
	<br>
	<br>	Wow. I've never seen you give up so easily.
	<br>
	<br>	Can you not start with me? can you not be so easy to start with?
	<br>
	<br>	Why are you taking his advice? he's old and alone. what?
	<br>
	<br>	Tell serena again without the pregnancy scare,
	<br>
	<br>	In a quiet, no distractions kind of way.
	<br>
	<br>	But then again, what do I know about romance,
	<br>
	<br>	Friends or anything else? no, no, no, no, no.
	<br>
	<br>	Actually, jen, that's-- that's a very good idea.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, right.
	<br>
	<br>	What would you do without me?
	<br>
	<br>	Promise me I will find out one day.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, b.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing here? in the neighborhood.
	<br>
	<br>	Can we talk later? despite your best efforts to ruin it,
	<br>
	<br>	I'm actually having a good day, and I don't want anything
	<br>
	<br>	To spoil it. guess who asked me to visit the captain with him?
	<br>
	<br>	Yes. it's like he finally needs me and isn't afraid to-- look, b.,
	<br>
	<br>	To burst your happy bubble, but I'm not giving up. well, I'm sorry,
	<br>
	<br>	I haven't been on the pill since I was 15. okay, I am giving up.
	<br>
	<br>	Before you start planning your perfect night with nate,
	<br>
	<br>	Don't you think you should-- I'm not pregnant, serena.
	<br>
	<br>	What's wrong? was it something I cooked?
	<br>
	<br>	No. no, no, no. I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	It's honestly the best spaghetti I've ever tasted.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you, even if I did have to drag it out of you myself.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, guys.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	Go back to your room, jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm just getting juice.
	<br>
	<br>	Excuse me.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, jen. could you do me a favor
	<br>
	<br>	And drink your juice at vanessa's, maybe?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm going back to my room, closing the door,
	<br>
	<br>	Putting on my headphones and ignoring you and your date. excellent.
	<br>
	<br>	Where were we?
	<br>
	<br>	Um...
	<br>
	<br>	Well, let--let's try this.
	<br>
	<br>	Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
	<br>
	<br>	Then it can be on our minds,
	<br>
	<br>	And our minds can worry about what's on your mind, together.
	<br>
	<br>	I have no idea what you just said.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know what I said either, but, um,
	<br>
	<br>	What I'm saying now is talk to me.
	<br>
	<br>	I never thought I was pregnant.
	<br>
	<br>	The test was for blair. oh, wait, wait. I'm confused.
	<br>
	<br>	She just got back together with nate.
	<br>
	<br>	So... oh. then who?
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck?
	<br>
	<br>	And blair?
	<br>
	<br>	Blair and chuck?
	<br>
	<br>	Then why isn't he the one buying the test? because...
	<br>
	<br>	Because he's an ass. who doesn't know.
	<br>
	<br>	Why not?
	<br>
	<br>	I mean, there's no love lost between me and chuck bass,
	<br>
	<br>	But I gotta believe he--he deserves to know.
	<br>
	<br>	He--he does have this weird influence over her.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe he could talk her into taking the test.
	<br>
	<br>	I just-- I'm so worried about her.
	<br>
	<br>	Come here.
	<br>
	<br>	This may be the most amazing purchase you'll ever make
	<br>
	<br>	In your entire lovely existence. your day almost over?
	<br>
	<br>	Not quite. I've got a few canvases to wrap
	<br>
	<br>	And a little more paperwork.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm trying to get you to ask me out for after-work drinks.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, oh. uh, okay.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry I didn't realize,
	<br>
	<br>	I guess you're not done for the day after all,
	<br>
	<br>	But when you are, call me.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi, rufus. remember me?
	<br>
	<br>	Bex, right? art dealer.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, you bought a very special piece
	<br>
	<br>	For lily van der woodsen.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm looking for some things for a couple other clients.
	<br>
	<br>	Any new discoveries since the last time I was here? a few.
	<br>
	<br>	There's a beautiful mixed media piece on this wall over here.
	<br>
	<br>	As I recall, you had a wife in hudson.
	<br>
	<br>	That still true?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, she's still there. I'm still here.
	<br>
	<br>	Made things a little difficult.
	<br>
	<br>	Still trying?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm trying to move on.
	<br>
	<br>	Hmm. tomorrow night too soon to start?
	<br>
	<br>	I suppose not.
	<br>
	<br>	Sounds good.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi, chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	Please, call me "brother."
	<br>
	<br>	I need to talk to you.
	<br>
	<br>	About getting knocked up? I must say
	<br>
	<br>	I was a little disappointed you weren't more careful.
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck, I really need to trust you.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm hoping that deep down inside,
	<br>
	<br>	You're actually a decent person
	<br>
	<br>	And won't make me regret this.
	<br>
	<br>	You're here for blair, aren't you?
	<br>
	<br>	Look, I'm not going to tell nate about us.
	<br>
	<br>	I tortured her, got bored and moved on.
	<br>
	<br>	There's no moving on just yet.
	<br>
	<br>	The pregnancy test wasn't for me. it was for blair.
	<br>
	<br>	What? she won't take it.
	<br>
	<br>	So given that if she's pregnant, you're the-- no, we used a condom.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, obviously, it broke. what is obvious
	<br>
	<br>	Is that your best friend has kept you in the dark.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you talking about? like I said,
	<br>
	<br>	I handle my business. apparently, nate doesn't.
	<br>
	<br>	They slept together just after we did.
	<br>
	<br>	It's him you should be asking for help.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, dad.
	<br>
	<br>	I need to talk to to you about something.
	<br>
	<br>	Whoa, whoa, whoa. it's a little early in the morning
	<br>
	<br>	For the teens-gone-wild contingency plan, isn't it?
	<br>
	<br>	It's not about your relationship with serena. oh. oh, then what?
	<br>
	<br>	I need to know how you and jenny would feel
	<br>
	<br>	If I went out tonight for a drink... with a woman.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, I guess I feel like you shouldn't wear that shirt,
	<br>
	<br>	Or there will not be a second date.
	<br>
	<br>	Really? r-really.
	<br>
	<br>	Thanks.
	<br>
	<br>	Now I guess I just have to worry about jenny then.
	<br>
	<br>	Good morning. hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Good morning, sunshine.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad, where'd you get that shirt?
	<br>
	<br>	What's wrong with this shirt? nothing,
	<br>
	<br>	As long as you don't plan to wear it out of the house.
	<br>
	<br>	It's worse. he plans on wearing it on a date.
	<br>
	<br>	For drinks, if that's okay. whatever. it's awful.
	<br>
	<br>	Guess you have your answer. answer to what?
	<br>
	<br>	Nothing. nothing.
	<br>
	<br>	Morning.
	<br>
	<br>	Good morning, miss serena.
	<br>
	<br>	Anybody notice the weather today? what?
	<br>
	<br>	Take a look outside, b. my first response
	<br>
	<br>	Would be that the sky is a clear blue easy.
	<br>
	<br>	Dorota, you may be excused now.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe you didn't tell me about you and nate.
	<br>
	<br>	What did he say? noing. chuck did, when I went to see him
	<br>
	<br>	Because I thought maybe he could talk some sense into you.
	<br>
	<br>	You had no right to do that. I was trying to help you, b.
	<br>
	<br>	Let another rumor about me run rampant.
	<br>
	<br>	The whole school heard, even dan.
	<br>
	<br>	What's going on?
	<br>
	<br>	Ask blair. her version of the story's always better.
	<br>
	<br>	Fine.
	<br>
	<br>	You all right?
	<br>
	<br>	Never been better.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, serena has. what's wrong?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know. I can't be held responsible for her mood swings.
	<br>
	<br>	Were you arguing
	<br>
	<br>	About the possibility
	<br>
	<br>	That your condition may have returned?
	<br>
	<br>	No. and it hasn't.
	<br>
	<br>	I heard you...
	<br>
	<br>	The other day,
	<br>
	<br>	In your bathroom, with the water running.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm very stressed.
	<br>
	<br>	And with you and serena down my throat,
	<br>
	<br>	I can hardly think straight, never mind keep food down.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe you do just need to take a little bak, , h?
	<br>
	<br>	Visit your father? lyon is beautiful this time of year. maybe this summer.
	<br>
	<br>	Summer sounds great. finish your breakfast.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not pregnant.
	<br>
	<br>	I command myself not to be pregnant.
	<br>
	<br>	Hello? hey, s. it's b.
	<br>
	<br>	Two things.
	<br>
	<br>	First... I'm sorry
	<br>
	<br>	About dan, about the "gossip girl" blast
	<br>
	<br>	And about not telling you about nate. okay.
	<br>
	<br>	You were just so hard on me about chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't want to be judged for sleeping with them both.
	<br>
	<br>	I understand. apology accepted.
	<br>
	<br>	That was fast. if I were you,
	<br>
	<br>	I would've made me work for it a little bit harder.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, I think you've suffered enough. and second thing--
	<br>
	<br>	Wait. that's already, like, three things. I took the test.
	<br>
	<br>	Aah! oh, my gosh! are you kidding me?
	<br>
	<br>	Aah!
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, I am so happy.
	<br>
	<br>	I would have had no idea what to wear to a paternity hearing. clean slate?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, clean slate. oh, I'm so happy.
	<br>
	<br>	See you at school.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, don't stop on my account. oh, I have to.
	<br>
	<br>	Secondhand smoke is bad for the, uh... I'm not pregnant, so good-bye,
	<br>
	<br>	Mistake so far in my past I can hardly remember.
	<br>
	<br>	You cannot be serious. you can't be touching me.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, if you were gonna tell nate,
	<br>
	<br>	You would have done so in monaco,
	<br>
	<br>	But you don't want him to hate you, and you know he would.
	<br>
	<br>	Game over. game's not over until I say it is.
	<br>
	<br>	Then have fun playing with yourself.
	<br>
	<br>	Got 'em.
	<br>
	<br>	Are--are--are you cold? I'm okay.
	<br>
	<br>	It's pretty cold. here, let me get you this blanket.
	<br>
	<br>	This will be better to keep you warm.
	<br>
	<br>	Um, you--you want some ginger ale?
	<br>
	<br>	Here. I brought this for us.
	<br>
	<br>	We can have a nice little drink.
	<br>
	<br>	Um, it might be a little cold, actually.
	<br>
	<br>	I--you okay? you're doing that, um... thing.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, i-i know. I'm sorry. i...
	<br>
	<br>	It's just... i-i don't know.
	<br>
	<br>	In--in the short time we've known each other,
	<br>
	<br>	You--you've become really important to me.
	<br>
	<br>	I've been struggling to find a way to tell you,
	<br>
	<br>	Struggling now.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, my lit paper. no, no, no, no, no.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh! no, no, no, no, no, no.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, my gosh. here you go.
	<br>
	<br>	I love you. thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	No problem. all right, take care.
	<br>
	<br>	That was a close call.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry. that would've completely ruined our picnic.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay, what, um, what was it you were saying?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, just...
	<br>
	<br>	I think I should proofread this for you. can i?
	<br>
	<br>	Sure. yeah, but can we eat first? 'cause I'm starving.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah. let's eat.
	<br>
	<br>	Can you believe this?
	<br>
	<br>	Jenny, come look at this.
	<br>
	<br>	Looks like the virgin queen
	<br>
	<br>	Isn't as pure as she pretended to be.
	<br>
	<br>	Who's your daddy, b.? baby daddy, that is.
	<br>
	<br>	Two guys in one week? talk about doing the nasty,
	<br>
	<br>	Or should I just say being nasty?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, my god. you know she's right about this.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, god, there she is. what a total hypocrite.
	<br>
	<br>	Who does she think she is?
	<br>
	<br>	Pot calling the kettle black much?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, I can see a bump! what a bitch.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, my god, she is such a whore.
	<br>
	<br>	She cheated on nate?! does nate know?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, god!
	<br>
	<br>	Have you seen nate?
	<br>
	<br>	No.
	<br>
	<br>	I saw it.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, blair's gonna freak out. I mean, this is a total lie.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	Of course it is.
	<br>
	<br>	Jenny, look, I know you're friends with blair,
	<br>
	<br>	And you'd never want to do anything to betray her,
	<br>
	<br>	But if you know something... well, blair was never really my friend.
	<br>
	<br>	So...
	<br>
	<br>	So...
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, there's something you should know.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know if you would want to her...
	<br>
	<br>	Whoa, man!
	<br>
	<br>	Did you sleep with her, huh?
	<br>
	<br>	You son of a bitch. I could kill you.
	<br>
	<br>	What'd you do? did you get what you wanted,
	<br>
	<br>	Like you do with all those other girls? yes, nathaniel. I took what blair
	<br>
	<br>	Kept throwing at you and you kept throwing back.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, so somehow you screwing blair for sport is my fault?
	<br>
	<br>	It wasn't for sport. she needed someone, and I was there.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, so you cared about her?
	<br>
	<br>	You guys were broken up. what, for how long? a week? an hour?
	<br>
	<br>	Look, I am sorry, all right?
	<br>
	<br>	I know how long you and I have been best friends, okay?
	<br>
	<br>	No, it's not okay, chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	From now on, you stay away from me. nate.
	<br>
	<br>	Did you hear what I said?
	<br>
	<br>	You stay the hell away from me, chuck!
	<br>
	<br>	Show's over.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing here? your mom let me in.
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't ask how you got in. I asked why you came.
	<br>
	<br>	To talk.... about us.
	<br>
	<br>	There's no "us," blair.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, there is. we finally really have a chance to start over.
	<br>
	<br>	You know, all this time, I felt so b for everything I've done,
	<br>
	<br>	And when you said you wanted to leave the past in the past,
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't know we were talking about your past.
	<br>
	<br>	I made a decision I was in no condition to make.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes. then you'll understand perfectly when I say
	<br>
	<br>	I want nothing else to do with you, blair.
	<br>
	<br>	You and chuck deserve each other. you know chuck would say anything,
	<br>
	<br>	But jenny wouldn't. jenny?
	<br>
	<br>	And don't go blaming any of this on her, blair.
	<br>
	<br>	I would have found out eventually. I said I'm done.
	<br>
	<br>	It's over. now would you please leave?
	<br>
	<br>	Fine. stay as long as you like. I'll leave.
	<br>
	<br>	Bryn. hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Good to see you again.
	<br>
	<br>	Rufus, at the risk of being forward,
	<br>
	<br>	I'm here on a dare from my friends to ask you out.
	<br>
	<br>	Then I guess I have to say, uh...
	<br>
	<br>	Yes? yes, you do.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, tonight, I have plans, but maybe some other night...
	<br>
	<br>	Am I interrupting?
	<br>
	<br>	Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, bryn, bex. bex, bryn.
	<br>
	<br>	Actually, I'm bex. she must be... bryn.
	<br>
	<br>	I always get a little tongue-tied with my b's.
	<br>
	<br>	Looks like you're still tied up.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe we should reschedule drinks. no, that-- that won't be necessary.
	<br>
	<br>	Actually, I think it will. good to meet you, bryn. you, too. bye.
	<br>
	<br>	Guess you're available after all.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, b. what's up?
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe you told jenny about me and chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	What? i-i didn't.
	<br>
	<br>	Because of her, everybody knows the intimate details
	<br>
	<br>	Of my private life, and now nate's not speaking to me. but i-i told you,
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't tell jenny. I don't know how she found out. did you tell dan?
	<br>
	<br>	What?
	<br>
	<br>	You did. you told your low-rent boyfriend,
	<br>
	<br>	And he told his social-climbing sister
	<br>
	<br>	Who wears my hand-me-downs, and she blabbed to nate.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe you're attacking dan and jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	Did you or did you not tell him?
	<br>
	<br>	I did,
	<br>
	<br>	But only because you weren't dealing with it,
	<br>
	<br>	And I wanted advice on how to help you. I can't believe you don't get it.
	<br>
	<br>	The rules are different
	<br>
	<br>	For the serena van der woodsens of the world.
	<br>
	<br>	People expect you to party and be wild,
	<br>
	<br>	Sleep with whoever you want, run away, come back. wait,
	<br>
	<br>	You shot your reputation to hell a long time ago.
	<br>
	<br>	It doesn't matter what you do, but I'm a waldorf. well,
	<br>
	<br>	Obviously don't need me and my low-rent taste,
	<br>
	<br>	You and the waldorf name can weather the storm alone.
	<br>
	<br>	With pleasure.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Are you joining us? um...
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing here? I was just leaving.
	<br>
	<br>	No, stay.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair, given you can barely manage your own messy affairs,
	<br>
	<br>	Surely you're not in a position to tell anyone
	<br>
	<br>	Where they can and can't eat. do you realize who you're talking to?
	<br>
	<br>	You mean a self-righteous bitch who always sat
	<br>
	<br>	On her own high horse judging everyone else? pregnant little hypocrite.
	<br>
	<br>	Not that it's any of your business,
	<br>
	<br>	But I'm not pregnant.
	<br>
	<br>	Nate must be thrilled. chuck, too.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you talking about?
	<br>
	<br>	The whole school saw them throwing down
	<br>
	<br>	Over your cheap ass.
	<br>
	<br>	The boyfriend and the best friend? pretty classy.
	<br>
	<br>	Consider yourself dethroned,
	<br>
	<br>	Queen b.
	<br>
	<br>	Nn jey.consider yourself dethroned,
	<br>
	<br>	It is highly unlikely
	<br>
	<br>	That I will ever forgive you for going to nate,
	<br>
	<br>	But if you walk away from me now,
	<br>
	<br>	I will also ruin you.
	<br>
	<br>	How are you gonna do that?
	<br>
	<br>	Good to see you again.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay. bye. take care. enjoy.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi. it's bex. you know what to do.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi. it's rufus,
	<br>
	<br>	Calling again to apologize about last night again.
	<br>
	<br>	I really didn't mean to insult you or disrespect you
	<br>
	<br>	Or whatever it is I did.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm new at this, and well...
	<br>
	<br>	I'm new at this.
	<br>
	<br>	You told jenny about blair and chuck?
	<br>
	<br>	No. no, of course not.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, you're the only one I told.
	<br>
	<br>	And I didn't tell anybody.
	<br>
	<br>	How can I know that?
	<br>
	<br>	Because I gave you my word.
	<br>
	<br>	Because I love you.
	<br>
	<br>	What?
	<br>
	<br>	I love you,
	<br>
	<br>	And not just because I thought you were pregnant
	<br>
	<br>	And not in the way you love
	<br>
	<br>	Some random guy who picks up your lit paper
	<br>
	<br>	Or some girl who likes your hair.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	"okay"?
	<br>
	<br>	That response is not okay.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm such an ass. let me guess. dan?
	<br>
	<br>	He told me loved me,
	<br>
	<br>	And all I did was stand there like a stupid mute.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean, why wouldn't I want to hear those words
	<br>
	<br>	Come out of his mouth? but it's like it made me trust him less,
	<br>
	<br>	Which is crazy, and even if he is lying about telling jenny,
	<br>
	<br>	Even though I told him not to tell anyone,
	<br>
	<br>	I should have come up with a better response to "i love you.
	<br>
	<br>	But why would you think he was lying? because I'm the only one who knew,
	<br>
	<br>	And he's the only one I told.
	<br>
	<br>	On your conversations when you thought I wasn't? ooh. none, I hope.
	<br>
	<br>	You hope wrong. I'm a little brother.
	<br>
	<br>	It's what I do, and you don't have to be a genius
	<br>
	<br>	To figure out the trust thing. I mean, every time
	<br>
	<br>	Mom brought home someone who said, "i love you,"
	<br>
	<br>	They would end up married. and then divorced.
	<br>
	<br>	Didn't leave us with a strong sense of trust, huh?
	<br>
	<br>	But that's mom's issue, not ours,
	<br>
	<br>	And dan's not one of those guys.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay, this conversation has to end,
	<br>
	<br>	Because you're getting dangerously close
	<br>
	<br>	To being smarter than I am,
	<br>
	<br>	No, thank you. all right.
	<br>
	<br>	I came to congratulate you in person.
	<br>
	<br>	You ruined my relationship with nate,
	<br>
	<br>	Serena, all of my friends.
	<br>
	<br>	Even little jenny thinks she's too good for me,
	<br>
	<br>	So... bravo.
	<br>
	<br>	Just like you wanted.
	<br>
	<br>	I have no one to turn to but you.
	<br>
	<br>	Actually, you don't even have me.
	<br>
	<br>	Enough.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll try to be more succinct.
	<br>
	<br>	You held a certain fascination
	<br>
	<br>	When you were beautiful,
	<br>
	<br>	Delicate...
	<br>
	<br>	And untouched.
	<br>
	<br>	But now you're like...
	<br>
	<br>	One of the arabians my father used to own--
	<br>
	<br>	Rode hard and put away wet.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't want you anymore,
	<br>
	<br>	And I can't see why anyone else would.
	<br>
	<br>	You okay?
	<br>
	<br>	I'd be a lot better if I could spend a semester
	<br>
	<br>	Going to school in france.
	<br>
	<br>	A semester?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i-i already talked to harold about a visit,
	<br>
	<br>	And he was-- he was thrilled.
	<br>
	<br>	So can I go?
	<br>
	<br>	Now?
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, please try.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair, I am very concerned.
	<br>
	<br>	So book a flight.
	<br>
	<br>	We'll get you out tomorrow.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Who's up for a barneys drive-by?
	<br>
	<br>	Me. ooh. followed by hot sake at decibel.
	<br>
	<br>	Huh. I don't think so. yeah. she made out with the bartender last time.
	<br>
	<br>	Now he thinks she loves him. what about you, little j.?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, I can't. I have to return these books to the library.
	<br>
	<br>	Elise will take them for you,
	<br>
	<br>	Won't you, e.?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, sure.
	<br>
	<br>	It's okay. I can do it.
	<br>
	<br>	The question isn't if you can do it, jenny,
	<br>
	<br>	It's if you should have to.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm going there anyway.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	Let me know if you need anything else.
	<br>
	<br>	You coming?
	<br>
	<br>	Props to blair. she trained you well.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Don't act so surprised to see me.
	<br>
	<br>	How could I not stop by
	<br>
	<br>	After all those pitiful messages you left? oh, for the record,
	<br>
	<br>	I'm really sorry for what happened the other night. so am i.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, bex, I was married for almost 20 years,
	<br>
	<br>	And before that, I was a somewhat successful musician,
	<br>
	<br>	And I wouldn't really call what I was doing dating. what was it then?
	<br>
	<br>	A succession of women--
	<br>
	<br>	Groupies, mostly-- whose chose me.
	<br>
	<br>	I really don't have any experience
	<br>
	<br>	With real honest-to-goodness dating.
	<br>
	<br>	Despite your worst efforts,
	<br>
	<br>	I am completely charmed by you, rufus humphrey.
	<br>
	<br>	Thanks, I think.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	Here's where we are.
	<br>
	<br>	Dating 101, lesson 1.
	<br>
	<br>	In two days, you're gonna call me
	<br>
	<br>	And thank me for forgiving you of your dating faux pas.
	<br>
	<br>	You'll ask me out to dinner-- someplace elegant
	<br>
	<br>	But intimate, and we are going to have a fabulous time.
	<br>
	<br>	You got all that? absolutely.
	<br>
	<br>	Good. talk to you in two days. two days.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	Hello?
	<br>
	<br>	I never was good at following rules.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey. what are you doing here?
	<br>
	<br>	I need to know why you love me.
	<br>
	<br>	Because I do.
	<br>
	<br>	I really want to trust you when you say those words, dan,
	<br>
	<br>	So maybe if I knew why, I'd stop being so scared of hearing them
	<br>
	<br>	And afraid to say them.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, if you want to talk about why--
	<br>
	<br>	It has to do with my mom and her many marriages.
	<br>
	<br>	There. that's why.
	<br>
	<br>	Because I actually like it when you interrupt me,
	<br>
	<br>	Which is often, by the way.
	<br>
	<br>	I love you because you make no apologies
	<br>
	<br>	About being exactly who you are--
	<br>
	<br>	Beautiful, smart,
	<br>
	<br>	Sexy as hell--
	<br>
	<br>	Now you're embarrassing me.
	<br>
	<br>	That's another reason.
	<br>
	<br>	You're completely unaware of your affect on me.
	<br>
	<br>	You're also completely unaware
	<br>
	<br>	That you laugh like a 4 year old.
	<br>
	<br>	Just like that.
	<br>
	<br>	And I love you because you can be with someone like me
	<br>
	<br>	And still be best friends with someone like blair.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, well, I tried to be.
	<br>
	<br>	I know you do, and that's not easy,
	<br>
	<br>	But you never give up on her.
	<br>
	<br>	That is how amazing you are.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, you're amazing, too,
	<br>
	<br>	For being able to say all of those things,
	<br>
	<br>	You just are.
	<br>
	<br>	And I love you...
	<br>
	<br>	But I have to go.
	<br>
	<br>	What? what--what is it this time?
	<br>
	<br>	One of the many reasons you love me.
