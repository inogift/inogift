<p class="full-script">Serena: You don't even talk to her, why do you care how she does?</p>

<p class="full-script">Dan: So... So you don't need these?</p>

<p class="full-script">Vanessa: While we all love hearing about the struggles of the idle rich, Dan's got a fine tutor right here. I ace every practice test I take. So we don't need your hand-me-downs.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan: Um, you know what? This is actually pretty good. This looks good. Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Vanessa: Is there a reason you insist on looking so desperate and needy?</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan, to Nate: She's been like that since we were kids. Venomous without provocation.</p>
<p class="full-script">Vanessa: It's better than being a charity case!</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan: She's rude, too.</p>

Isabel, you're a concert pianist, but Itzhak Perlman himself gave Nelly her very first violin. Hazel... You're just along for the ride, okay? But if any of us wants to live out our college dreams, we have to find Nelly Yuki's weakness and exploit it. So what's it gonna be, aromatherapy or annihilation?</p>

<p class="full-script">Nate: ...Why?</p>
<p class="full-script">Vanessa: Because I judged the cover, but now that I've read the book, I figured you were owed some apologetic souvlaki at the very least. </p>

<p class="full-script">Serena: No, you can...</p>
<p class="full-script">Georgina, with a huge glass of vodka: Yeah listen, let's have dinner. I-I mean, I want to hear about your life, and if you can change, maybe there's hope for me, too.</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: No, I... I have to study. I have SATs in the morning.</p>

<p class="full-script">Blair, on phone: Hey S, it's B. Now I'm really worried. I'm gonna go home and change, and then... (She sees Vanessa and N.) Call me, bye. </p>
<p class="full-script">(Lonelyboy and B stare as N's towncar drives away.) </p>
<p class="full-script">(Lonelyboy knocks on Chuck's door; S waits a moment before opening it.)</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan, relieved: Hey!</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: Hey.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan: What's going on?</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena, stepping back: Um... Nothing. I'm fine.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan: No you're not, and you need to stop saying that. Hey, come here. Where were you?</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck, appearing: She was with me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: What he means is, we were both at home. Um, my stomach started acting up again...</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan: Oh, okay. A food poisoning relapse? Look, if... If you didn't study enough and you're freaked out, I can...</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: -- I told you. I was sick.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan: You paid someone else to take the SAT for you, and that's the best you can do?</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan: I'm talking about the five-foot-nothing redhead claiming to be Serena Van Der Woodsen. I'm... I'm pretty sure that wasn't you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: Chuck, what did you do? I told you to keep the doors open. When I got there, they were closed.</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck: Yeah, they don't keep the doors open. I was thinking on my feet, just trying to help.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan, touching her face: I'm not mad, okay? I'm just worried. I've been so worried about you. Please, help me understand what's going on here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena, sadly: Can we talk tomorrow? I'll call you. I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan: I'm sorry, too. </p>
<p class="full-script">(Chuck reaches to close the door, and Dan leaves.)</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: Chuck, you went too far.</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck: And so did you, sis. Look, I feel foolish for admitting it, but obviously I've come late to this party.</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: English, please.</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck: What's Georgina got on you?</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: Chuck...</p>
<p class="full-script">Chuck: Dan, I understand -- but what's so bad you can't even tell me? </p>
<p class="full-script">(S walks away.) </p>
<p class="full-script">(G answers a knock at the door; it's S.)</p>
<p class="full-script">Georgina: Oh, hi sweetie. Let me just, uh, call some room service...</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena, from the doorway: I don't want you to ever contact me again.</p>
<p class="full-script">Georgina: Just because of a few nights of harmless fun?</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: It wasn't fun waking up and not knowing where I was, it wasn't fun missing the SATs, and it definitely wasn't fun lying to Dan.</p>
<p class="full-script">Georgina: And this is all my fault because...</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: -- My fault. Because I make huge mistakes when I'm with you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Georgina: So you want to distance yourself from your mistakes by staying away from me? You were there too, Serena. It was just as much you, if not more...</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: -- This is not about last year. It's about last night.</p>
<p class="full-script">Georgina: Like you were just some innocent bystander who walked in on...</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: I'm not talking about it, Georgina! Okay? And neither are you. If I go down, you go down with me. In the meantime, stay out of my life.</p>
<p class="full-script">Georgina: I don't need anybody in my life who doesn't want to be there.</p>
<p class="full-script">Serena: Then we're agreed. </p>
<p class="full-script">(Georgina slams the door, and starts to pack angrily before changing her mind.) </p>
<p class="full-script">(Rufus answers the door at the loft; it's Asher.)</p>
<p class="full-script">Rufus: You must be the Unity boy.</p>
<p class="full-script">Asher, shifting a big paper bag full of hotdogs to shake hands: Uh, hopefully there's not another one on his way. Name's Asher, and I do go to Unity. Hi.</p>
<p class="full-script">Jenny, appearing: Asher? What are you doing here?</p>
<p class="full-script">Rufus: I was just gonna ask the same thing.</p>
<p class="full-script">Asher, showing her the bag: Uh, since you couldn't come to the hotdogs, I'm bringing them to you. Sorry to surprise you, sir.</p>
<p class="full-script">Jenny: That's so sweet, especially since my unreasonable father has grounded me for life.</p>
<p class="full-script">Rufus: I'm standing right here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Asher: I wish more of my friends' parents cared enough to ground them when they messed up.</p>
<p class="full-script">Gossip Girl: Looks like our queen wannabe's found her perfect king.</p>
<p class="full-script">Rufus: Well, since you're here, with a ... year's supply of hotdogs, maybe you'd like to come in.</p>
<p class="full-script">Gossip Girl: &quot;We hear he's a Unity man. Guess big brother's been teaching little sis how to snag the ones with a trust fund.&quot; </p>
<p class="full-script">(Lonelyboy broods in the park; a golden retriever runs up.)</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan: Hey, buddy. There you go.</p>
<p class="full-script">Georgina: Aw! Georgie, hey! Bad boy! Sorry he disturbed you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan: Uh, it's fine. I love dogs.</p>
<p class="full-script">Georgina: Really? Do you have any?</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan: No. Uh, we used to have a cat, but, you know, sister, allergies. Now the cat, Iggy, lives in Florida with my Grandma. I... He doesn't write. Never calls.</p>
<p class="full-script">Georgina: I'm sorry to hear that.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan, handing her the leash: It's just a cat.</p>
<p class="full-script">Georgina: Um. I'm Sarah, by the way.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dan: I'm Dan. Nice to meet you, Sarah.</p>
