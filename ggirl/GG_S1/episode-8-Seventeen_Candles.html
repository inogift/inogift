<div class="full-script">
	<br>	Your one and only source into the
	<br>	scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
	<br>
	<br>	I remember the first
	<br>	time i ever saw him.
	<br>
	<br>	I knew.
	<br>
	<br>	He's the one i wanna marry.
	<br>
	<br>	I think you dropped this at the ball.
	<br>
	<br>	I hate secrets more than anything.
	<br>
	<br>	You're dismissed,jenny...
	<br>
	<br>	For good.
	<br>
	<br>	Something about
	<br>	uh,uh,mom and a neighbor?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,it's... Complicated.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom's having an affair.
	<br>
	<br>	It's easy for me to say it.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom,it's time for you to come home.
	<br>
	<br>	I was with my friend vanessa.
	<br>
	<br>	We're very close,and she moved
	<br>	away to vermont last year,
	<br>
	<br>	And now she's back.
	<br>
	<br>	You said you love me.
	<br>
	<br>	Dan,hungry?
	<br>
	<br>	Hello.
	<br>
	<br>	- Hi.
	<br>	- Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Nathaniel,i'm shocked.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought you were
	<br>	strictly an herbal man.
	<br>
	<br>	The drugs were dad's.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean,i guess he thought it would be
	<br>	easier on everyone if i took the hit.
	<br>
	<br>	I have to say,every time i look at anne's
	<br>	finger and see blair's future engagement ring...
	<br>
	<br>	I can hardly contain my joy.
	<br>
	<br>	It seems your father is
	<br>	facing some other charges.
	<br>
	<br>	For what?
	<br>
	<br>	Embezzlement and fraud.
	<br>
	<br>	You should deal with your father.
	<br>
	<br>	He needs you.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't.
	<br>
	<br>	Where's nate?
	<br>
	<br>	- I think we just broke up.
	<br>	- What?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't wanna talk about it.
	<br>
	<br>	I just want to escape.
	<br>
	<br>	That's what this place is for,right?
	<br>
	<br>	Gossip Girl
	<br>	Season01 Episode08
	<br>
	<br>	According to the catholic church,
	<br>
	<br>	Mortal sin can only be absolved
	<br>	through the sacred act of confession,
	<br>
	<br>	But it looks like a
	<br>	certain w.a.s.p.Princess
	<br>
	<br>	has recently found herself desperately
	<br>	in need of a little unburdening.
	<br>
	<br>	And who is the man
	<br>	upstairs to discriminate?
	<br>
	<br>	Forgive me,father,for i have sinned.
	<br>
	<br>	It's been...
	<br>
	<br>	A while since my last confession.
	<br>
	<br>	What troubles you,my child?
	<br>
	<br>	After being broken up with my
	<br>	boyfriend for exactly 20 minutes,i...
	<br>
	<br>	Succumbed to inebriation,
	<br>
	<br>	performed at a speakeasy and surrendered
	<br>	my virtue to a self-absorbed ass.
	<br>
	<br>	The only good news is that he's a total
	<br>	pig who will act like it never happened.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank god.
	<br>
	<br>	Sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	Truthfully,i'm not even catholic.
	<br>
	<br>	You don't say.
	<br>
	<br>	But losing my virginity to chuck bass?
	<br>
	<br>	None of my friends will ever understand.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm ready for my punishment.
	<br>
	<br>	Whatever you and god think
	<br>	is fair-- flogging,fasting,
	<br>
	<br>	Putting that thing with the
	<br>	teeth around my thigh,like silas.
	<br>
	<br>	How about some food for thought instead?
	<br>
	<br>	Don't drink.
	<br>
	<br>	Keep your clothes on.
	<br>
	<br>	Try avoiding those who
	<br>	might cause you to stray.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,i plan to.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you,father.
	<br>
	<br>	It was very good advice.
	<br>
	<br>	You don't grant birthday wishes,do you?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm a priest,not a genie.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,the next time you talk to him,
	<br>
	<br>	Would you ask him to send
	<br>	my boyfriend back to me?
	<br>
	<br>	I gotta say...
	<br>
	<br>	No need to say anything.
	<br>
	<br>	God,i hate people in love.
	<br>
	<br>	Awkward.
	<br>
	<br>	Vanessa?
	<br>
	<br>	Serena. Dan.
	<br>
	<br>	No,no,no,no,no,no. Vanessa's here.
	<br>
	<br>	Lovebirds ready to order?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,i'll take 'em.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	So,uh,you--you
	<br>	work here now?
	<br>
	<br>	I did mention that,but
	<br>	you've been distracted.
	<br>
	<br>	Vanessa. Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Nice to see you.
	<br>
	<br>	This time you're seeing less of me.
	<br>
	<br>	Sorry about that.
	<br>
	<br>	Walking in when you were,you know...
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	So you guys are up early.
	<br>
	<br>	What'd you do last night?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,my god.
	<br>
	<br>	I totally didn't mean to pry.
	<br>
	<br>	You're not prying.
	<br>
	<br>	Why would you think you're prying?
	<br>
	<br>	- No reason.
	<br>	- No reason.
	<br>
	<br>	Did you tell her?
	<br>
	<br>	What? No.What's to tell?
	<br>
	<br>	I know nothing,but if you guys
	<br>	did the thing i know nothing about,
	<br>
	<br>	Then i would totally support that.
	<br>
	<br>	Thanks,vanessa.
	<br>
	<br>	Good to know in the
	<br>	event that should happen.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,meaning it didn't happen?
	<br>
	<br>	Meaning i don't even know what
	<br>	we're talking about right now.
	<br>
	<br>	I know i'm lost.
	<br>
	<br>	And i should get lost.
	<br>
	<br>	First day. I have lots of tables.
	<br>
	<br>	Clearly.
	<br>
	<br>	So vanessa works here now.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,we should make
	<br>	this our regular spot.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,this is the last place
	<br>	i'd expect to find you.
	<br>
	<br>	Go away,chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	I've been given orders practically
	<br>	from god himself to avoid you.
	<br>
	<br>	Would you consider
	<br>	avoiding me over breakfast?
	<br>
	<br>	Sorry,but as is tradition on
	<br>	the day before my birthday,
	<br>
	<br>	I'm heading to the jeweler's to put
	<br>	some pieces on hold for eleanor and--
	<br>
	<br>	nate?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,i don't think he'll be singing
	<br>	"happy birthday" this year.
	<br>
	<br>	No one knows that nate and i broke up,
	<br>
	<br>	And it's gonna stay that
	<br>	way so i can fix this,
	<br>
	<br>	And i don't think your best friend would
	<br>	still be your best friend if he knew--
	<br>
	<br>	If he knew how much i enjoyed the removal of a
	<br>	certain chastity belt in the back of this very limo?
	<br>
	<br>	From this moment forward,
	<br>
	<br>	The events of last night
	<br>	will never be mentioned again.
	<br>
	<br>	Is that clear?
	<br>
	<br>	Not as clear as the memory
	<br>	of you purring in my ear,
	<br>
	<br>	Which i have been
	<br>	replaying over and over.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,erase the tape,because as far
	<br>	as i'm concerned, It never happened.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll see you at your party tonight.
	<br>
	<br>	You're officially uninvited.
	<br>
	<br>	Never stopped me before.
	<br>
	<br>	Speak of the devil,and he doth appear,
	<br>
	<br>	Wearing his trademark scarf. Careful,b.
	<br>
	<br>	Hell hath no fury like
	<br>	a chuck bass scorned.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,dad.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi,honey.
	<br>
	<br>	How was hudson? Your mother must have
	<br>	been kind of surprised to see you.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,she was.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi,rufus.
	<br>
	<br>	Alison.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing here?
	<br>
	<br>	Well,i asked her to come.
	<br>
	<br>	You know,i thought
	<br>	you guys could... Talk.
	<br>
	<br>	Or not.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay,dad,i know it wasn't my
	<br>	place to ask mom to come back...
	<br>
	<br>	- Jenny.
	<br>	- It's your life.
	<br>
	<br>	I get that,but it's my
	<br>	life,too,and it's dan's,
	<br>
	<br>	And i just felt that nothing's ever gonna
	<br>	change if someone doesn't do something.
	<br>
	<br>	Jenny!
	<br>
	<br>	Stop. Breathe.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not angry.
	<br>
	<br>	You're not?
	<br>
	<br>	Not at you.
	<br>
	<br>	While you can't get un-angry at mom
	<br>	If she's in hudson,and you're here,dad.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean,nothing's ever gonna change
	<br>	If you're not in the same room.
	<br>
	<br>	Can't you just give it a chance?
	<br>
	<br>	Not on an empty stomach.
	<br>
	<br>	Come. I'll make us breakfast.
	<br>
	<br>	Who wants waffles?
	<br>
	<br>	I mean,you do still
	<br>	like waffles,right,rufus?
	<br>
	<br>	You know me,al.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm a loyal guy.
	<br>
	<br>	Once i commit to
	<br>	something,i stick with it.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll get the syrup.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,mom.
	<br>
	<br>	I just got back from the
	<br>	jeweler's,and i have to say--
	<br>
	<br>	have you seen this?
	<br>
	<br>	Since when does drunk and
	<br>	disorderly get this much attention?
	<br>
	<br>	Since never.
	<br>
	<br>	The captain is being charged
	<br>	with embezzlement and fraud.
	<br>
	<br>	This is an absolute disaster.
	<br>
	<br>	It must be awful for them.
	<br>
	<br>	I meant for me.
	<br>
	<br>	The captain is supposed to represent me.
	<br>
	<br>	The contracts are about to be signed.
	<br>
	<br>	What about my i.p.o.,huh?
	<br>
	<br>	What is gonna happen
	<br>	to my bendel's deal?
	<br>
	<br>	Nate looks so helpless.
	<br>
	<br>	I have to call my attorney.
	<br>
	<br>	I-i have to put an end to this
	<br>	deal before it goes any further.
	<br>
	<br>	I have to talk to nate.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know why everybody's
	<br>	making such a big deal out of this.
	<br>
	<br>	It's just a misunderstanding.
	<br>
	<br>	It'll be cleared up in time.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes,it will,at your trial.
	<br>
	<br>	This is real,howard.
	<br>
	<br>	The only reason you're not
	<br>	behind bars right now is
	<br>
	<br>	Because your wife
	<br>	could afford your bail.
	<br>
	<br>	And i would've paid
	<br>	ten times that amount.
	<br>
	<br>	You're not going to jail.
	<br>
	<br>	And we're gonna do everything we
	<br>	can to make sure that doesn't happen,
	<br>
	<br>	But in the meantime,this is not
	<br>	something to be cavalier about.
	<br>
	<br>	It's clearly a setup.
	<br>
	<br>	Someone's got a agenda.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad,would you just shut
	<br>	up and listen to him?
	<br>
	<br>	Nate.
	<br>
	<br>	Look,sir,what exactly
	<br>	do we need to do here?
	<br>
	<br>	Remain calm and give them nothing
	<br>	but a united front as we fight this.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,what about some sort
	<br>	of,um,some sort of plea?
	<br>
	<br>	A plea?
	<br>
	<br>	You think i'm guilty?
	<br>
	<br>	Dad,it's just a question.
	<br>
	<br>	How would that work exactly?
	<br>
	<br>	It wouldn't.
	<br>
	<br>	Nate,i'm sure you're very tired,
	<br>
	<br>	And this is a conversation for adults.
	<br>
	<br>	Why don't you go get
	<br>	some rest,sweetheart?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,dad. Jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	And--and
	<br>	mom.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi,honey.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,look at this. The
	<br>	whole family's together...
	<br>
	<br>	Eating waffles.
	<br>
	<br>	Want one?
	<br>
	<br>	You bet.
	<br>
	<br>	Just one question.
	<br>
	<br>	Am i the only one who thinks
	<br>	this is extremely weird?
	<br>
	<br>	I-i mean,given everything.
	<br>
	<br>	Dan,just forget about it.
	<br>
	<br>	If dad can let it go,so can you.
	<br>
	<br>	What do you mean,let it go?
	<br>
	<br>	You know,the guy in hudson.
	<br>
	<br>	You told her?
	<br>
	<br>	No,of course i didn't tell her. Rufus.
	<br>
	<br>	I would never.
	<br>
	<br>	I overheard dan and dad talking.
	<br>
	<br>	He heard us arguing on the phone.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,if you want to keep secrets,
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe we should all abandon the loft
	<br>	and move to a place with more walls.
	<br>
	<br>	It's always gogood to give him a while.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,no,i
	<br>	knew--i knew that.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe he told her
	<br>	you guys were gonna do it.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,i told you.
	<br>
	<br>	That's different. I'm a girl.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,well,so is she.
	<br>
	<br>	Exactly my point.
	<br>
	<br>	But even if she wasn't,
	<br>
	<br>	When you get a boyfriend,you
	<br>	become the best friend,
	<br>
	<br>	And the best friend becomes
	<br>	the second best friend.
	<br>
	<br>	That's just how it has to
	<br>	be if it's ever gonna work.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,you still haven't
	<br>	told me how nate's doing.
	<br>
	<br>	It's all over the news.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,when i talked to him this morning,
	<br>
	<br>	I-i told him to focus
	<br>	on his family today.
	<br>
	<br>	But he's still coming
	<br>	to your party,right?
	<br>
	<br>	Here.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,i told him not to worry about it.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean,only if he's up to it.
	<br>
	<br>	You're such a good girlfriend,b.,really.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,um,i'll just pick you
	<br>	up,and we can go together,
	<br>
	<br>	But i really hope nate can make it.
	<br>
	<br>	nate,here you are.
	<br>
	<br>	I've been looking everywhere for you.
	<br>
	<br>	I was up in your room.
	<br>
	<br>	I was calling your name for 20 minutes.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,take your earphones out.
	<br>
	<br>	Take your earphones out.
	<br>
	<br>	Nathaniel,i've been
	<br>	calling you for 20 minutes.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry. What is it?
	<br>
	<br>	- Blair's birthday party is tonight,isn't it?
	<br>	- Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	I was thinking maybe you should
	<br>	give her something special.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sure she's already picked out something
	<br>	at the jewelry store and put it on hold.
	<br>
	<br>	Something more special than that.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom,that's a family heirloom.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not giving it to blair.
	<br>
	<br>	It's an engagement ring.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not asking you to propose,
	<br>
	<br>	But it's important that blair knows
	<br>	how much you value her loyalty.
	<br>
	<br>	Her loyalty or her mother's?
	<br>
	<br>	Eleanor's lawyers may have called.
	<br>
	<br>	What difference does it make?
	<br>
	<br>	One day we'll all be family,
	<br>
	<br>	And they won't have a
	<br>	choice in these matters.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair and i broke up last night.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,then get back together.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't think so.
	<br>
	<br>	May i remind you it was your own rash
	<br>	actions that got us into this predicament?
	<br>
	<br>	We're in this predicament
	<br>	because dad has a drug problem.
	<br>
	<br>	I was trying to help him
	<br>
	<br>	then help him.
	<br>
	<br>	Your father's acting the way
	<br>	that he is because he's scared.
	<br>
	<br>	He needs you so much right
	<br>	now,more than he ever has.
	<br>
	<br>	We all do.
	<br>
	<br>	Whoever thought monarchy was dead
	<br>	didn't realize it just changed zip codes.
	<br>
	<br>	So what will it be,nate,blair
	<br>	waldorf's hand or your father's head?
	<br>
	<br>	Hi. Are you okay?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,i've been texting you all day.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,i'm--i'm
	<br>	fine. Thanks.
	<br>
	<br>	I,um,just been a little busy.
	<br>
	<br>	I just wanted to check on
	<br>	you,see if you need anything.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,i kinda do.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair,do you think
	<br>	we've been a little--
	<br>
	<br>	A little hasty with the whole breakup?
	<br>
	<br>	I-i don't know,nate.
	<br>
	<br>	Um,it was a pretty difficult decision.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,look,i-i totally
	<br>	understand. I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	I,um,i shouldn't have brought it up.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,but we do have a
	<br>	lot of history together,
	<br>
	<br>	And,uh,it was in the heat of the moment,
	<br>
	<br>	But you'd have to be willing
	<br>	to really work for it.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,yeah,of course.
	<br>
	<br>	Listen,we'll just take it
	<br>	slow and see how it goes.
	<br>
	<br>	And,um,i've got a
	<br>	birthday present for you.
	<br>
	<br>	It's,uh,something special.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't wait to open it at my party.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll see you there.
	<br>
	<br>	I...
	<br>
	<br>	Hi. This is blair waldorf.
	<br>
	<br>	I was wondering if any of the pieces
	<br>	That i put on hold were picked up today.
	<br>
	<br>	The diamond necklace? Really?
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you!
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	Can we talk?
	<br>
	<br>	Well,that depends. Are
	<br>	you--are you back for good?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know.
	<br>
	<br>	Your father and i haven't
	<br>	really had a chance to talk,so...
	<br>
	<br>	Well,do you want to come back,
	<br>
	<br>	Or do you wanna live in
	<br>	hudson with,uh,neighbor guy?
	<br>
	<br>	Okay,look,dan,i understand
	<br>	that you're mad,all right?
	<br>
	<br>	And i'm not gonna defend what i did.
	<br>
	<br>	No,you--you don't
	<br>	get it,do you?
	<br>
	<br>	You think i'm only
	<br>	mad about the cheating?
	<br>
	<br>	Okay. What else?
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe that you promised you would be home
	<br>	by the end of summer,and then you weren't.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe the fact that you left at all.
	<br>
	<br>	I asked if you were
	<br>	okay with me going away,
	<br>
	<br>	And i'd hoped that if there was a
	<br>	problem, You would say something.
	<br>
	<br>	Like what?
	<br>
	<br>	"your daughter's a freshman at a school
	<br>	"populated by mean girls and date rapists?
	<br>
	<br>	I think she needs her mom."
	<br>
	<br>	Or maybe "my father is madly in love with
	<br>	you and will probably never get over this"?
	<br>
	<br>	Why should i have to tell you this?
	<br>
	<br>	- Where are you going?
	<br>	- Out.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll call later.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,that went well.
	<br>
	<br>	You know,i was thinking
	<br>	of going out also.
	<br>
	<br>	- There's something i kinda need to do.
	<br>	- Oh,yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	- You need some help?
	<br>	- Can i help you?
	<br>
	<br>	No,i'm good. Thanks.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on,man. I can hear you breathing
	<br>	on the other side of the door.
	<br>
	<br>	Is she anybody you can get rid of?
	<br>
	<br>	I just really need to
	<br>	talk to you,man. Please.
	<br>
	<br>	Nathaniel.
	<br>
	<br>	- Where's the girl?
	<br>	- In my dreams.
	<br>
	<br>	I was trying to get some shut-eye.
	<br>
	<br>	What's on your mind?
	<br>
	<br>	- It's my mom.
	<br>	- Sounds freudian.
	<br>
	<br>	She wants me to give blair her ring.
	<br>
	<br>	What? You guys broke up.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,i know.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean,uh,wait. How do you know?
	<br>
	<br>	Predictably,your ex ran the
	<br>	old,uh,grill-the-best-friend play.
	<br>
	<br>	Tried to find out
	<br>	where your head was at.
	<br>
	<br>	So,uh,where,uh,where is your head?
	<br>
	<br>	Spinning.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean,my mom wants me
	<br>	to get back with blair
	<br>
	<br>	So eleanor doesn't pull
	<br>	out of their business deal.
	<br>
	<br>	It's all because of my dad's
	<br>	whole trial thing,you know?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah. I'm sorry about all that,
	<br>
	<br>	But look,if you're
	<br>	done with blair,be done.
	<br>
	<br>	Don't cave to your parents'
	<br>	wishes if they're not your desires.
	<br>
	<br>	Excuse me? Where's my boy?
	<br>
	<br>	"seal the deal. Tap that ass.
	<br>
	<br>	Money marries bigger money"?
	<br>
	<br>	Look,i care about
	<br>	three things,nathaniel--
	<br>
	<br>	Money,the pleasures
	<br>	money brings me and you.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm just trying to have your back here.
	<br>
	<br>	Your parents have been
	<br>	controlling you your whole life.
	<br>
	<br>	If it doesn't end now,when will it ever?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,guys!
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,serena! Blair!
	<br>
	<br>	- Happy birthday!
	<br>	- Happy birthday!
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,my god,kati.
	<br>
	<br>	Your brother's place looks fabulous.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,i know,right?
	<br>
	<br>	I know. It's incredible.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on,guys. Let's check it out.
	<br>
	<br>	Hai. Douzo.
	<br>
	<br>	Arigatou gozaimasu.
	<br>
	<br>	- Douitashimashite.
	<br>	- Thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey. So where's nate?
	<br>
	<br>	Um,i'm sure he'll be here soon.
	<br>
	<br>	What about dan?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,uh,he said he's coming,but i haven't
	<br>	talked to him since this morning.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,you better check in on him.
	<br>
	<br>	Make sure the best friend hasn't whisked
	<br>	him away to do some friendly activity.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,shut up.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,there's chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	I bet he knows where nate is.
	<br>
	<br>	I think nate probably just
	<br>	snuck in while we were dancing.
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,thanks for listening to me
	<br>	complain about my family all afternoon.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,look,i know it's hard right now...
	<br>
	<br>	But your family's one of the good ones,
	<br>
	<br>	And your parents really love each other.
	<br>
	<br>	They'll figure it out,and in
	<br>	the meantime,you've got me.
	<br>
	<br>	We're here c u soon?
	<br>
	<br>	Um,actually,i was gonna
	<br>	go meet up with serena.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,sure. Have fun.
	<br>
	<br>	I will.
	<br>
	<br>	What are we doing?
	<br>
	<br>	I thought you said we
	<br>	weren't doing anything.
	<br>
	<br>	I like serena,and i like
	<br>	you,and she likes me,
	<br>
	<br>	And you like me,so how--how
	<br>	can you not like each other?
	<br>
	<br>	It's mathematically impossible.
	<br>
	<br>	Who said i didn't like her?
	<br>
	<br>	I just don't know her.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,and you're making a
	<br>	real effort to change that.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean,why spend five minutes
	<br>	trying to be nice to serena,
	<br>
	<br>	When i can spend day after day forced
	<br>	to choose between the two of you?
	<br>
	<br>	Okay,fine.
	<br>
	<br>	You want to see me get my nice on?
	<br>
	<br>	Let's do it tonight.
	<br>
	<br>	Just you,me and serena.
	<br>
	<br>	Tonight--tonight is blair
	<br>	waldorf's birthday party.
	<br>
	<br>	i think we might want to start by dipping
	<br>	a toe rather than diving off of a cliff,
	<br>
	<br>	Headfirst,into the
	<br>	rocks with the sharks.
	<br>
	<br>	Why? We all know how to swim.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on.
	<br>
	<br>	You want to do this,let's do it.
	<br>
	<br>	Are you ready for your present?
	<br>
	<br>	If you wanted to play
	<br>	rough,all you had to do was ask.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi.Hello there.
	<br>
	<br>	Happy birthday to me.
	<br>
	<br>	You nauseate me.
	<br>
	<br>	All this talk about how you have to
	<br>	be with nate or the world will end.
	<br>
	<br>	Face it. It's over.
	<br>
	<br>	You sound like a jealous boyfriend.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,right. You wish.
	<br>
	<br>	No.
	<br>
	<br>	You wish.
	<br>
	<br>	Please.
	<br>
	<br>	You forget who you're talking to.
	<br>
	<br>	So do you.
	<br>
	<br>	Do you... Like me?
	<br>
	<br>	Define "like."
	<br>
	<br>	you have got to be kidding.
	<br>
	<br>	I do not believe this.
	<br>
	<br>	How do you think i feel?
	<br>
	<br>	I haven't slept.
	<br>
	<br>	I feel sick,like there's
	<br>	something in my stomach,fluttering.
	<br>
	<br>	Butterflies?
	<br>
	<br>	No,no,no,no,no,no,no.
	<br>
	<br>	This is not--not
	<br>	happening.
	<br>
	<br>	Believe me,no one is more
	<br>	surprised or ashamed than i am.
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck,you know that i
	<br>	adore all of god's creatures
	<br>
	<br>	And the metaphors that
	<br>	they inspire,but...
	<br>
	<br>	Those butterflies have
	<br>	got to be murdered.
	<br>
	<br>	Fine.
	<br>
	<br>	- It wasn't that great anyway.
	<br>	- Thanks.
	<br>
	<br>	Jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	- Hi,nate.
	<br>	- Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	I told blair,and i shouldn't have.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,about what happened at the ball?
	<br>
	<br>	It's,uh,it's not your fault.
	<br>
	<br>	So...
	<br>
	<br>	How have things been between you guys?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,strange,but again,not your fault.
	<br>
	<br>	So you gonna go inside?
	<br>
	<br>	I was planning on it,but now
	<br>	that i'm here,i'm not so sure.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah. Me neither.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair invited me before our fight,
	<br>
	<br>	And i was gonna run in
	<br>	and give her this card,
	<br>
	<br>	Which says "i'm sorry," like,30 times.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe you could just
	<br>	deliver it for me,though?
	<br>
	<br>	do you wanna go take
	<br>	a walk or something?
	<br>
	<br>	With you?
	<br>
	<br>	Um,what would blair think?
	<br>
	<br>	Well,blair's up there.
	<br>
	<br>	Unless,of course,you
	<br>	wanna go. It's up to you.
	<br>
	<br>	A walk sounds good.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Dan,you're here!
	<br>
	<br>	And,um,and you brought vanessa.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey. Good to see you.
	<br>
	<br>	kati and
	<br>	is,you--you know dan.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,blair,this is,um,dan's
	<br>	friend vanessa.
	<br>
	<br>	You didn't mention they were so nice.
	<br>
	<br>	Now i get it.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,sweetie,you did not tell
	<br>	me she looked like that.
	<br>
	<br>	This is such a problem.
	<br>
	<br>	Rufus,i'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	I know that you're upset.
	<br>
	<br>	You're getting that,huh?
	<br>
	<br>	Can you please talk to me? Please?
	<br>
	<br>	I only have one question,and i'm pretty
	<br>	sure i don't want to hear the answer.
	<br>
	<br>	It happened one time,and i
	<br>	wish it hadn't,and it's over.
	<br>
	<br>	Then why did our daughter have to
	<br>	go to hudson and drag you back here?
	<br>
	<br>	Because when we spoke on the phone,
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't really get the impression
	<br>	that you wanted to see me.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought i should give you some space.
	<br>
	<br>	This family has had way too much space.
	<br>
	<br>	You never should have left.
	<br>
	<br>	Can we not go through this
	<br>	whole thing again? Please.
	<br>
	<br>	You know that i wasn't happy.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah. You happy now?
	<br>
	<br>	In some ways,i am.
	<br>
	<br>	I know you don't want to hear that.
	<br>
	<br>	Look,please don't act
	<br>	like you care what i want.
	<br>
	<br>	Rufus.
	<br>
	<br>	I was there for you when you
	<br>	were all about your music,
	<br>
	<br>	When you were on the road
	<br>
	<br>	for months at a time and
	<br>	everything that went with it.
	<br>
	<br>	My whole adult life has been about you.
	<br>
	<br>	And now i'm the one that's screwed up.
	<br>
	<br>	I guess i was a late bloomer.
	<br>
	<br>	I just need you to care
	<br>	enough about me to try.
	<br>
	<br>	Alison...
	<br>
	<br>	I care.
	<br>
	<br>	I care.
	<br>
	<br>	Stalk me much?
	<br>
	<br>	What are you still
	<br>	doing up here all alone?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know where nate is,and
	<br>	he always calls me at midnight,
	<br>
	<br>	When it turns into my birthday.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,i wouldn't count on it tonight.
	<br>
	<br>	Doesn't it strike you as,uh,just
	<br>	a little bit of coincidence,
	<br>
	<br>	The timing of everything?
	<br>
	<br>	What do you mean?
	<br>
	<br>	Well,nate suddenly decides he wants
	<br>	to get back together just moments
	<br>
	<br>	After your mother puts the brakes
	<br>	on her deal with the captain?
	<br>
	<br>	So you're saying that nate
	<br>	is only pretending to like me,
	<br>
	<br>	And that he's actually
	<br>	using me to get to my mother?
	<br>
	<br>	He wouldn't do that.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes,he would.
	<br>
	<br>	If it was to help his
	<br>	family,you know he would.
	<br>
	<br>	Nate loves me.
	<br>
	<br>	Whatever he's doing,wherever he is,
	<br>
	<br>	He will call at midnight. You'll see.
	<br>
	<br>	Care to make a wager?
	<br>
	<br>	If he calls,i'll leave
	<br>	you alone forever.
	<br>
	<br>	If he doesn't,you
	<br>	spend the night with me.
	<br>
	<br>	I will not.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought you were sure.
	<br>
	<br>	You're gonna lose.
	<br>
	<br>	He's never missed my birthday.
	<br>
	<br>	Careful,b.
	<br>
	<br>	There's no safe wager
	<br>	when you bet on a bass.
	<br>
	<br>	You just might lose your
	<br>	shirt and your pants.
	<br>
	<br>	So you brought vanessa as
	<br>	your date to blair's party?
	<br>
	<br>	No,no,you're my date.
	<br>
	<br>	I just thought it might be a good
	<br>	opportunity for all three of us to hang out.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,yeah,'cause it was so fun and not
	<br>	remotely awkward at breakfast this morning.
	<br>
	<br>	Fine. You're--you're--
	<br>	you're right.
	<br>
	<br>	I actually thought this would be a
	<br>	very bad opportunity for us to hang out,
	<br>
	<br>	But i kind of suggested to vanessa that
	<br>
	<br>	She wasn't making an
	<br>	effort to get to know you,
	<br>
	<br>	So,uh,she decided to start tonight,
	<br>
	<br>	But if it's weird,i can go talk to her.
	<br>
	<br>	No. No,no,no,don't do that.
	<br>
	<br>	Look,tell me something
	<br>	vanessa likes besides you,
	<br>
	<br>	And i will make an effort to bond.
	<br>
	<br>	I promise.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	So what now?
	<br>
	<br>	Ever play "guitar hero"?
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you. Thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,she owned you,serena.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,you went down almost as
	<br>	hard as britney at the v.m.a.s.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay,you know,you're good,vanessa.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll admit it,but i have
	<br>	been holding back until now.
	<br>
	<br>	There's a little birdie
	<br>	that's about to be free.
	<br>
	<br>	That's my girl!
	<br>
	<br>	That's it. Right there.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you. Thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Who got on now?
	<br>
	<br>	Not bad,but skynyrd
	<br>	is meat and potatoes,
	<br>
	<br>	And i'm bringing dessert,
	<br>
	<br>	So what do you say to
	<br>	a slice of "cherry pie"?
	<br>
	<br>	No pie.
	<br>
	<br>	I say no,i beg you.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on.
	<br>
	<br>	There's nothing like a little '80s
	<br>	hair metal to put a smile on your face.
	<br>
	<br>	After the day you've had?
	<br>
	<br>	The--the day
	<br>	you've had?
	<br>
	<br>	What-- what kind
	<br>	of day have you had?
	<br>
	<br>	You didn't tell her?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,no. No,not yet.Not yet.
	<br>
	<br>	it was kind of an odd
	<br>	day at the humphrey loft.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,actually,jenny brought my mom home.
	<br>
	<br>	Your mom's back?
	<br>
	<br>	- Yeah.
	<br>	- Excuse me.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe you didn't
	<br>	tell me your mom came home.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry,really.
	<br>
	<br>	What? You didn't think it was important?
	<br>
	<br>	No,no,of course it is.
	<br>
	<br>	Why bother? You already told vanessa.
	<br>
	<br>	I tell vanessa everything,all right?
	<br>
	<br>	I have since i was 6.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,you're not 6 anymore,dan.
	<br>
	<br>	I just--i was just hoping
	<br>	that i would be the person
	<br>
	<br>	That you would wanna
	<br>	tell these things to now.
	<br>
	<br>	I want you to be that person,too.
	<br>
	<br>	Really,i do.
	<br>
	<br>	This whole girlfriend thing
	<br>	is very new to me,you know?
	<br>
	<br>	I-i just... I don't
	<br>	know all the rules yet.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,blair says in a
	<br>	relationship,the best friend is--
	<br>
	<br>	Serena,you're really taking
	<br>	relationship advice from blair?
	<br>
	<br>	Good point.
	<br>
	<br>	Look,i just don't want to
	<br>	have to compete with vanessa.
	<br>
	<br>	You know,with "guitar hero," okay.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm way more awesome,if
	<br>	you didn't happen to notice.
	<br>
	<br>	But,um,not with you.
	<br>
	<br>	That's fair.
	<br>
	<br>	All right,so tomorrow,you and
	<br>	i will go somewhere together,
	<br>
	<br>	Just the two of us,
	<br>
	<br>	And we will talk about my family in
	<br>	excruciating detail until you are--
	<br>
	<br>	You're just so bored,you're begging
	<br>	for vanessa to take over,all right?
	<br>
	<br>	- How's that sound?
	<br>	- Perfect.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on. It's almost midnight.
	<br>
	<br>	What happens at midnight?
	<br>
	<br>	I heard about your dad.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,if it makes you feel any better,
	<br>
	<br>	My family's not doing that
	<br>	great right now either.
	<br>
	<br>	You know,i actually didn't
	<br>	want to come to blair's party
	<br>
	<br>	As much as i just wanted
	<br>	to get out of my house.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,i know the feeling.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair's birthday present.
	<br>
	<br>	Your mother's ring.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair told me about it.
	<br>
	<br>	It's beautiful.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm,uh,supposed to give
	<br>	it to blair tonight.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm guessing that wasn't your idea.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair and i broke up,and i know
	<br>	it was the right thing to do.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean,we just shouldn't be
	<br>	together right now,you know?
	<br>
	<br>	Sounds like you're pretty sure of that.
	<br>
	<br>	I am,and as much as i wanna do the
	<br>	right thing and help out my parents,
	<br>
	<br>	It's just--it's
	<br>	not fair.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean,to me or to blair.
	<br>
	<br>	I just think that if i do this
	<br>	now,when does it ever stop?
	<br>
	<br>	It'll only stop when you stop it.
	<br>
	<br>	12:01
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	No,you're smarmy.
	<br>
	<br>	There's a difference.
	<br>
	<br>	If you're coming to
	<br>	collect,you can forget it.
	<br>
	<br>	Turn around.
	<br>
	<br>	You get grosser by the second.
	<br>
	<br>	You get older. Look.
	<br>
	<br>	Happy birthday!
	<br>
	<br>	- Blair,blow out your candles.
	<br>	- I know.
	<br>
	<br>	Make a wish,blair.
	<br>
	<br>	It already didn't come true.
	<br>
	<br>	Happy birthday to who?
	<br>
	<br>	Forget cake and ice cream.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm saving room for just desserts.
	<br>
	<br>	Looks like chuck's wish might come true.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	So i don't know how it was
	<br>	possible given how the day started,
	<br>
	<br>	But,um,i actually had
	<br>	kind of a good night.
	<br>
	<br>	Your parents won't be mad
	<br>	you're coming home so late,right?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,no,they think i'm with a friend.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,they think right.
	<br>
	<br>	I had fun.
	<br>
	<br>	Me,too.
	<br>
	<br>	You have a good night.
	<br>
	<br>	Spotted--nate archibald depositing a
	<br>	mystery girl in a taxi after midnight.
	<br>
	<br>	All we know about her for sure?
	<br>
	<br>	She's not blair waldorf.
	<br>
	<br>	FROM:GOSSIP GIRL HAPPY BIRTHDAY,B!
	<br>
	<br>	****Maybe she's wrong.
	<br>
	<br>	It wouldn't be the first time.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair,hey,i'm so sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	I never would've thought
	<br>	that this would happen.
	<br>
	<br>	I hope the slut gave him herpes.
	<br>
	<br>	Cheater totally deserves herpes.
	<br>
	<br>	He isn't cheating.
	<br>
	<br>	We broke up,okay?
	<br>
	<br>	He was gonna get back together with me,
	<br>
	<br>	But only so my mom would help his dad.
	<br>
	<br>	You satisfied?
	<br>
	<br>	Blair.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair,stop,okay? Talk to me.
	<br>
	<br>	We ended it.
	<br>
	<br>	I wanted to tell you,
	<br>
	<br>	But--but part of
	<br>	me thought that
	<br>
	<br>	If i didn't say it out
	<br>	loud,then it wouldn't be true.
	<br>
	<br>	It was my birthday wish
	<br>	for us to get back together.
	<br>
	<br>	Now i think it's really over.
	<br>
	<br>	Is it okay if i just wanna
	<br>	be alone for a second?
	<br>
	<br>	Nate,hey.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing home so early?
	<br>
	<br>	It's after midnight.
	<br>
	<br>	We just thought you'd be with blair.
	<br>
	<br>	How did she like her gift?
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't make it to the party tonight.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,her actual birthday is today.
	<br>
	<br>	You can call her in the
	<br>	morning,maybe take her to lunch.
	<br>
	<br>	It's a good plan.
	<br>
	<br>	Really more special this way.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad,i know you think
	<br>	blair will help save you,
	<br>
	<br>	But i'm not doing this.
	<br>
	<br>	- It's over.
	<br>	- Nate.
	<br>
	<br>	There's nothing in this world i
	<br>	wouldn't do to protect our family,
	<br>
	<br>	And i'm sure you feel the same.
	<br>
	<br>	I need your support
	<br>	here,son,and your trust.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,you better hope for your sake
	<br>	they don't call your son to the stand.
	<br>
	<br>	God,i have missed your smile.
	<br>
	<br>	I have missed everything.
	<br>
	<br>	Please tell me that is someone
	<br>	coming to rob the house.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,mom.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,dad.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	As you were.
	<br>
	<br>	Is your friend gonna be okay?
	<br>
	<br>	i'm not sure.
	<br>
	<br>	She just broke up with her boyfriend,
	<br>
	<br>	And then they got back together
	<br>
	<br>	And then,um,i don't
	<br>	know what just happened.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,she's lucky to have you.
	<br>
	<br>	Being a good friend is...
	<br>
	<br>	Challenging at times?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,if i've been acting
	<br>	however i've been acting,
	<br>
	<br>	It's just 'cause i'm protective of dan.
	<br>
	<br>	And i'm protective of our relationship.
	<br>
	<br>	I've never actually had one before.
	<br>
	<br>	You guys just have everything in common,
	<br>
	<br>	And,um,i'm just getting to know him.
	<br>
	<br>	So,you know,it can be
	<br>	a little intimidating.
	<br>
	<br>	Talk about intimidating.
	<br>
	<br>	You just admitted that
	<br>	you find me intimidating,
	<br>
	<br>	So how cool does that make you?
	<br>
	<br>	I think you forgot to mention
	<br>	my superior "guitar hero" skills.
	<br>
	<br>	No,i didn't forget that.
	<br>
	<br>	And at the next party,i'm
	<br>	asking for a rematch,
	<br>
	<br>	'Cause you were about to get smoked.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,really?
	<br>
	<br>	Well,i think the only thing getting smoked
	<br>	is your pale imitation of a guitar player.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,i am a golden god.
	<br>
	<br>	really?Are you now? Hey.Am--am
	<br>	i interrupting anything?
	<br>
	<br>	actually,you are.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll give you guys a moment.
	<br>
	<br>	Might that have been bonding
	<br>	that i just walked in on?
	<br>
	<br>	- A little bit.
	<br>	- Yeah?
	<br>
	<br>	What were you talking about?
	<br>
	<br>	Nothing you need to know about.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,so you have secrets now? I see.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,listen,um,if you
	<br>	want to get out of here,
	<br>
	<br>	Vanessa can only fit two
	<br>	on her vespa,but i can walk.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,well,you know i love me a vespa,
	<br>
	<br>	But,um,i think i gotta
	<br>	stay here and be with blair.
	<br>
	<br>	- You're not the only one with a best friend.
	<br>	- Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not in the mood,chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	This is pretty much
	<br>	the worst birthday ever.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe it can be salvaged.
	<br>
	<br>	Is that our sex tape?
	<br>
	<br>	It's the erickson beamon necklace.
	<br>
	<br>	No,i couldn't.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes,you can.
	<br>
	<br>	Something this beautiful deserves to
	<br>	be seen on someone worthy of its beauty.
	<br>
	<br>	I really am sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	Spotted--b.
	<br>
	<br>	Turning a year older,but
	<br>	not necessarily wiser.
	<br>
	<br>	Guess chuck's the gift
	<br>	that keeps on giving.
	<br>
	<br>	Blow out your candles,b.
	<br>
	<br>	This will be better in the dark.
	<br>
	<br>	X.o.x.o.,gossip girl.
