	<br>
	<br>	That, too.
	<br>
	<br>	Don't worry, B

	<br>
	<br>	Come on. Let's go.

	<br>
	<br>	Well...
	<br>
	<br>	Who said you need a silver spoon
	<br>
	<br>	to dole out just desserts?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, Jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	Can i talk to you just for a second?
	<br>
	<br>	I'll meet you guys, okay?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, so I may have told Blair
	<br>
	<br>	you told me the truth about heanand Chuck
	<br>
	<br>	And I'm sure she didn't react well to that.
	<br>
	<br>	But you don't know what you're dealing with here.
	<br>
	<br>	- I'm not scared of Blair - No, I'm not talking about...
	<br>
	<br>	I'm talking about...talking about your new circle.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean, they've been friends with Blair forever,
	<br>
	<br>	and look what they're doing to her.
	<br>
	<br>	When you fall out of line,
	<br>
	<br>	what do you think this gonna happen to you?
	<br>
	<br>	I won't fall out of line.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not saying you're gonna...
	<br>
	<br>	It's just...
	<br>
	<br>	You're not like those girls, Jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	That's weird, Nate. Since they're my friends, you think we have some stuff in common
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, I will give you this...
	<br>
	<br>	You've got good name

	<br>
	<br>	You're Blair Waldorf, remember?
	<br>
	<br>	Right. These are my steps,
	<br>
	<br>	and i'm not gonna relinquish them
	<br>
	<br>	without a fight, though it would be helpful
	<br>
	<br>	maybe there was one more person in our crowd.
	<br>
	<br>	Only old people and children and...
	<br>
	<br>	Ugh, there's Chuck
	<br>
	<br>	and a blond mini-Chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	He's trying to torture me.
	<br>	220
	<br>
	<br>	- ...I can't believe it. - I know.
	<br>

	<br>	Which one? You know,I never wear the same thing twice
	<br>
	<br>	Mommy taught me well. Hey,dad
	<br>
	<br>	You missed dinner,kiddo. Oh,yeah,um,I'm studying at hazel's
	<br>
	<br>	And I guessed I lost track of time. Um,I'm not mad
	<br>
	<br>	I just feel like I haven't seen you in a while
	<br>
	<br>	We haven't even discussed your birthday. I was gonna do something with my friends...
	<br>
	<br>	Oh. That's great,honey
	<br>
	<br>	But since I have nothing to wear
	<br>
	<br>	I don't think that's happening anymore
	<br>
	<br>	Well,if you want to be with your friends
	<br>
	<br>	We can do the family thing over the weekend
	<br>
	<br>	Sweetheart?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,yeah. I'll be home soon,dad
	<br>
	<br>	Okay. Bye
	<br>
	<br>	Hello? Hi
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,no check,honey. The drink's on us,
	<br>
	<br>	Unless you want something else?
	<br>
	<br>	Yes.
	<br>
	<br>	Another bellini,
	<br>
	<br>	This seared squab
	<br>
	<br>	And a bus person of separated tables
	<br>
	<br>	Please
	<br>
	<br>	One may be the loneliest number...
	<br>
	<br>	Information. What city and state,please?
	<br>
	<br>	Brooklyn. I think that's in New York
	<br>
	<br>	But sometimes only the lonely can play
	<br>
	<br>	Wake up,little Jenny. The bitch is back
	<br>
	<br>	I thought you said you didn't have anything else
	<br>
	<br>	Well,I found some stuff in the back of my closet
	<br>
	<br>	hmm. Do you want to go with cash again
	<br>
	<br>	Or do you want to buy your sewing machine back?
	<br>
	<br>	Neither. I want that dress
	<br>
	<br>	Honey,this is $1,200
	<br>
	<br>	Um,this one's... quite lovely
	<br>
	<br>	Ah,well,that's more my color
	<br>
	<br>	I'd say we take the jet to croatia
	<br>
	<br>	Where young Eric here
	<br>
	<br>	can exploit the lesser age of consent
	<br>
	<br>	Am I invited to the Bachelor party? Brother,please
	<br>
	<br>	Then head west to monte carlo
	<br>
	<br>	For some all-night cards at metropole
	<br>
	<br>	And swing by giza
	<br>
	<br>	Just to watch the sun come up over the Pyramids
	<br>
	<br>	What do you think,father? I think we're here
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,see you at home,Bart
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck will catch up in a minute
	<br>
	<br>	You almost ruined things between me and Lily once before
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not gonna let that happen again
	<br>
	<br>	What are you talking about? I'm talking about the focus stunt you pulled at dinner
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't send Serena that package
	<br>
	<br>	And quite frankly
	<br>
	<br>	Her violated virgin Mary act is getting pretty old
	<br>
	<br>	I thought making you my best man would help
	<br>
	<br>	What is that supposed to mean?
	<br>
	<br>	Inspire you to valuey y happiness
	<br>
	<br>	Over your own childish agenda
	<br>
	<br>	Things seem to be working out for you at that club Victrola
	<br>
	<br>	I'm thinking you might like me to invest more in the place
	<br>
	<br>	So you can have more control?
	<br>
	<br>	In exchange for good behavior,of course.
	<br>
	<br>	You're bribing me?
	<br>
	<br>	So we have a deal then?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,why aren't you school? I'm taking the morning off
	<br>
	<br>	Volunteering to help those less fortunate than myself.
	<br>
	<br>	Wow. You're in a good mood.
	<br>
	<br>	Butter with the girls must have gone well last night?
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't go,actuall
	<br>
	<br>	why not? I think she should work a little harder for my forgiveness
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,Dan's not hanging out in brooklyn again this morning
	<br>
	<br>	He's with you at school,right? No,not yet,but he'll be here soon. Why?
	<br>
	<br>	Just tell him I say hi
	<br>
	<br>	Okay
	<br>
	<br>	Hi
	<br>
	<br>	Jenny's dad?
	<br>
	<br>	We met briefly at thanksgiving
	<br>
	<br>	Ah,yeah...
	<br>
	<br>	Hi
	<br>
	<br>	Got three cases of champagne for Serena van der woodsen
	<br>
	<br>	No,no. I'm Serena van der woodsen
	<br>
	<br>	But those aren't mine
	<br>
	<br>	Well,the purchase order never lies. Salud
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,guys,I just got this incredible dolce
	<br>
	<br>	You wanna see? It's unbelievable
	<br>
	<br>	You can't turn your back in your own house.What are you guys talking about?
	<br>
	<br>	My mother's vavalentino was stolen. Oh,my god
	<br>
	<br>	It was made especially for her
	<br>
	<br>	It was the same year he did,uh
	<br>
	<br>	Jackie o.'S lace wedding mini
	<br>
	<br>	Well,did someone break in? No,and the maid swore to the police
	<br>
	<br>	That she didn't take it,but she'll probably get fired.Wait,police for a dress?
	<br>
	<br>	It's worthy $15,000. My mother told the maid if she returned it
	<br>
	<br>	She could work something out. Like she'll bring it back
	<br>
	<br>	Well,you never know. I mean,it could turn up
	<br>
	<br>	Right,cause really,where is she gonna wear it?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm really glad,because when I spoke to her
	<br>
	<br>	She mentioned the plans with the girls falling through
	<br>
	<br>	Nope. Tell you the truth,I didn't really believe her. why?
	<br>
	<br>	I thought she was just conflicted
	<br>
	<br>	About choosing friends over family
	<br>
	<br>	Well,you know that's the biggest struggle
	<br>
	<br>	With a girl of her age. Memory doesn't serve...
	<br>
	<br>	Trying to reconcile who you're becoming
	<br>
	<br>	With who you used to be
	<br>
	<br>	She's been running herself ragged,Mr Humphrey
	<br>
	<br>	Swedling two worlds?Well,I know she was running herself ragged
	<br>
	<br>	Trying to get into one of those worlds
	<br>
	<br>	Picking up dry cleaning,gowns for masked balls...
	<br>
	<br>	Well,it's no easier once you're in.
	<br>
	<br>	She needs some relief.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,then that's what she'll get.
	<br>
	<br>	Whatever I can do to help.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,thank god.
	<br>
	<br>	Betty? Hi. Excuse me. Um...
	<br>
	<br>	Would you pardon me for a moment,please??
	<br>
	<br>	I need to trade back
	<br>
	<br>	All right,you can keep the scarf and the shoes,
	<br>
	<br>	- I'm sorry,but that's just not gonna be possible. - what? Why?
	<br>
	<br>	You know,when you leave here with an item,
	<br>
	<br>	You're agreeing to its value.
	<br>
	<br>	The dolce sold at $1,200.
	<br>
	<br>	The valentino... Is seven times that.
	<br>
	<br>	Please look,this has sentimental value,
	<br>
	<br>	- And I didn't realize - no,I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	A couple of hours ago,this dress was mine,all right?
	<br>
	<br>	Doesn't even have tags on it yet.
	<br>
	<br>	Look,it's not my fault
	<br>
	<br>	That you don't know what a valentino's worth.
	<br>
	<br>	Hello? Nate,it's Jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	- What's going on? - Listen,I wouldn't be calling you
	<br>
	<br>	I have anyone else to turn to,
	<br>
	<br>	But I made a mistake,and I need to fix it,
	<br>
	<br>	- And I really need borrow some money.I - Jenny,just slow down.
	<br>
	<br>	- I promise I'll pay you back. - Is everything okay?
	<br>
	<br>	- Ah,I just--I madea mistake,and I need to fix it. - well,how much?
	<br>
	<br>	$8,000.00
	<br>
	<br>	$8,000? Jenny,what do you need that kind of money for?
	<br>
	<br>	You know what? Forget it. I'm sorry I bothered you.
	<br>
	<br>	The price of fitting in
	<br>
	<br>	Might have gotten a little steeper...
	<br>
	<br>	But little J. Still knows
	<br>
	<br>	It's what's underneath that counts.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,we could put this one on a mylar tablecloth
	<br>
	<br>	And pretend it's a bar mitzvah.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,there you are. I have a date with Dan.
	<br>
	<br>	Could you excuse us?
	<br>
	<br>	You're gonna say something worse than the bar mitzvah remark?
	<br>
	<br>	Serena,I think we should talk about any feelings
	<br>
	<br>	You might be having about my upcoming marriage.
	<br>
	<br>	Ay,but you're asking me this now because...
	<br>
	<br>	Cause I got a call from your headmistress
	<br>
	<br>	Who said that there was something
	<br>
	<br>	About a case of alcohol?
	<br>
	<br>	Well,I thought you may be acting out.
	<br>
	<br>	Great,mom. I actually woke up this morning,and I thought,
	<br>
	<br>	Mm. I'm a little uncertain about my mother's wedding.
	<br>
	<br>	"why don't I invite the entire junior class
	<br>
	<br>	Out to the courtyard for a champagne toast. - You have whole things like this before.
	<br>
	<br>	Obviously,Chuck's master plan is working.
	<br>
	<br>	Can't believe you think Chuck is doing these things.
	<br>
	<br>	Looking good to everyone in my life isn't enough for him.
	<br>
	<br>	He has to make me look bad or crazy..
	<br>
	<br>	Well,Chuck may be eccentric,but I doubt he's diabolical.
	<br>
	<br>	What's he done now?
	<br>
	<br>	I'll tell you what he's done.
	<br>
	<br>	Surprise!
	<br>
	<br>	Wow.
	<br>
	<br>	Happy birthday,Jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	Um,dad,I ca--I can't believe you did all this.
	<br>
	<br>	And,uh,Blair's here.
	<br>
	<br>	Um,this is so great
	<br>
	<br>	That all of you are here
	<br>
	<br>	In my house.
	<br>
	<br>	I should go change.
	<br>
	<br>	- Uh,you got it? - Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	Don'think she was surprised.
	<br>
	<br>	- What's Blair doing here? - I don't know.
	<br>
	<br>	- This party's kind of weird. - Weird? It's time for its induction
	<br>
	<br>	To the birthday hall of lame.
	<br>
	<br>	So not what I pictured
	<br>
	<br>	the guy on the phone about the loft party. - Can't believe we gave up our table for this.
	<br>
	<br>	Mint mojitos at socialista,
	<br>
	<br>	Mint milanos with Jenny's dad.
	<br>
	<br>	He's kind of a hottie.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,a hottie dad.
	<br>
	<br>	How long do we have to stay?
	<br>
	<br>	Rice krispie treats?
	<br>
	<br>	- You can't believe how mad Bart was. - Yes,I can,
	<br>
	<br>	'Cause you've told me about three times.
	<br>
	<br>	Wonder what they're gonna do to him.
	<br>
	<br>	- I wish I could see his face. - Hey,you know what? I've got some stories,too,
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,about seeing my mother
	<br>
	<br>	For the first time since she left at christmas.
	<br>
	<br>	- I'm the worst girlfriend. - No,you're not.you're not.
	<br>
	<br>	And there's the funny visit to my grandma
	<br>
	<br>	At the old folks' home--
	<br>
	<br>	- Two women,a sponge bath and a bedpan. - I'm sorry,you're right.
	<br>
	<br>	I wanna be here right now with you.
	<br>
	<br>	- And--and Nate. - What?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,guys.
	<br>
	<br>	- hey - hey
	<br>
	<br>	Sorry to interrupt. Your mom told me you guys were here.
	<br>
	<br>	Can I speak with you for one second,Dan?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh,yeah.Yeah,sure.
	<br>
	<br>	All right. Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	So have you spoken with your sister at all today?
	<br>
	<br>	- no. Why? What's wrong? - I don't know she just called me.
	<br>
	<br>	She was really freaked out,didn't know where to turn.
	<br>
	<br>	- She asked to borrow $8,000. - What? Why?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah,I don't know. I tried to get her
	<br>
	<br>	Tell me what was going on,but she wouldn't say anything.
	<br>
	<br>	Please? Dad,just get out,okay I need to change!
	<br>
	<br>	- Honey,can't you tell me what's going on? - nothing,just leave!
	<br>
	<br>	- Are you crying? Are you upset about the party? - No,can we talk about this later,okay?
	<br>
	<br>	Really just need to get out of this dress.
	<br>
	<br>	Uhh,it's stuck!
	<br>
	<br>	Okay,all right.
	<br>
	<br>	Just help me,okay? Help me get it off.
	<br>
	<br>	- Honey,you have to calm down. - No,hurry up.
	<br>
	<br>	- Did you get it? - I need a pair of pliers.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad...
	<br>
	<br>	Sorry. Sorry. We were just looking for our wraps.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll get them.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,my god.
	<br>
	<br>	That's my mother's dress.
	<br>
	<br>	No,you guys,I got this--at resurrection.
	<br>
	<br>	Remember,I was telling you
	<br>
	<br>	- About the really great dress I bought? - Her mother's one-of-a-kind valentino
	<br>
	<br>	That just happened to disappear from her closet. - She must have given it away, forgotten or something.
	<br>
	<br>	Are you calling my daughter a thief?
	<br>
	<br>	Well-- excuse me.
	<br>
	<br>	This feels private,so I'm gonna head out now.
	<br>
	<br>	I have a table at butter.
	<br>
	<br>	Reservation's under Waldorf,in case there's an after party.
	<br>
	<br>	Spotted-- Jenny in a red dress
	<br>
	<br>	With the red hands to match.
	<br>
	<br>	Looks like other disgrace is the name on the label.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair said they told you
	<br>
	<br>	The original party had fallen through
	<br>
	<br>	That they could surprise you with a better one.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair's a liar. You got played.
	<br>
	<br>	She also said that you were afraid
	<br>
	<br>	The girls wouldn't accept everything about you.
	<br>
	<br>	She knew you were wrong. She wanted you to feel like you had nothing to be ashamed of.
	<br>
	<br>	Was that a lie,too?
	<br>
	<br>	Where did you get the dress?
	<br>
	<br>	And I know you didn't make it,
	<br>
	<br>	Cause your sewing machine is gone.
	<br>
	<br>	You have no idea how hard it is,dad.
	<br>
	<br>	I sold my sewing machine,okay?
	<br>
	<br>	- What? - Ah,and a lamp and some jewelry.
	<br>
	<br>	Why?
	<br>
	<br>	Because i had to.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad,did you think that you can just send me off to school
	<br>
	<br>	Th a plaid skirt and a metrocard,
	<br>
	<br>	And everything will be okay. I am not apologizing
	<br>
	<br>	For not having a private plane for you,jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	U think i'm ashamed of where i come from?
	<br>
	<br>	No,dad,what i a ashamed of
	<br>
	<br>	Having to bring a brown-bag lunch to school,
	<br>
	<br>	D,you know,eat it in the bathroom,
	<br>
	<br>	And then go out with my friends
	<br>
	<br>	And pretend that i'm not hungry
	<br>
	<br>	When i go to lunch with them.
	<br>
	<br>	U don't have to do those things,jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	You're making a choice.
	<br>
	<br>	Why don't you get?
	<br>
	<br>	Do you want me to choose to have no friends?
	<br>
	<br>	Look,clearly,
	<br>
	<br>	I mean,that's not even a choice anymore,
	<br>
	<br>	Because that's just done.
	<br>
	<br>	I should probably get back.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,thank you for staying with me
	<br>
	<br>	- while i hid out from my house of horrors. - Oh,no problem.
	<br>
	<br>	,do you think jennyll be all right? Yeah,dan's a good guy.
	<br>
	<br>	He'll take care of her.
	<br>
	<br>	U are,too,you know,a good guy--
	<br>
	<br>	A forgiving guy
	<br>
	<br>	Who can't pit himself against blair forever.
	<br>
	<br>	good night.i'm sorry you gave me an opening.
	<br>
	<br>	Couldn't resist. I'm just saying.
	<br>
	<br>	- How are you doing,man? - Night.
	<br>
	<br>	- Hey. - Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	- Where have you been? - Therapy.
	<br>
	<br>	For four hours?,well,before i was--i was playing wii tennis with chuck
	<br>
	<br>	At this guy named brantfthth's house?
	<br>
	<br>	why are you hanging out with him?
	<br>
	<br>	Brantforth?
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck is fun,okay?
	<br>
	<br>	He's cool to me,and he doesn't treat me like some freak
	<br>
	<br>	- At just out the ostroff center. - Who treats you like that?
	<br>
	<br>	guys at st. Jude's,the girls at constance,
	<br>
	<br>	- A at the korean deli on 75TH street. - Eric...
	<br>
	<br>	And he's not--he's not always caref a around me,
	<br>
	<br>	Like--like one bad thing,and i'll break or something.
	<br>
	<br>	Besides,i always wanted a brother.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm trying it out,you know? Here.
	<br>
	<br>	what's this? chuck said it came for you this morning.
	<br>
	<br>	Thought you might want to open it out of the house,
	<br>
	<br>	Just in case.why didn't he bring it to me himself?
	<br>
	<br>	Cause he thought you wanted him to stay away from you.
	<br>
	<br>	Whoa. Is that coke?
	<br>
	<br>	How do you like a brother who use you as a drug mule?
	<br>
	<br>	Serena,i.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey. Who turned 12?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh,please don't rub it in.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad,what happened?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	You okay?
	<br>
	<br>	You wanna tell me why you needed to borrow $8,000?
	<br>
	<br>	Not really.
	<br>
	<br>	H,i can't believe nate told you.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,he was worried about you,
	<br>
	<br>	At you might be turning into some hideous upper et t cyborg.
	<br>
	<br>	He said that?
	<br>
	<br>	No. No,i did.
	<br>
	<br>	Just got in way over my head.
	<br>
	<br>	U know,i thought i could trade the dress
	<br>
	<br>	wear it that night and return it,
	<br>
	<br>	But just...
	<br>
	<br>	Look,uh...
	<br>
	<br>	It's your birthday,
	<br>
	<br>	I think we should get some ice cream,
	<br>
	<br>	And we can talk about all this stuff later,okay?
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
