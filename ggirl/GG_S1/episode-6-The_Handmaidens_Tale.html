<h1>Gossip Girl Season 1 - 6 - THE HANDMAIDEN'S TALE</h1>




<div class="full-script">
	<br>	GOSSIP GIRL HERE--
	<br>	YOUR ONE AND ONLY SOURCE
	<br>
	<br>	INTO THE SCANDALOUS LIVES OF MANHATTAN'S ELITE. (Kati) YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE WHAT'S ON "GOSSIP GIRL."
	<br>
	<br>	(Isabel) SOMEONE SAW SERENA GETTING OFF A TRAIN
	<br>
	<br>	AT GRAND CENTRAL. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS GOOD BETWEEN US.
	<br>
	<br>	IT WAS,BEFORE I FOUND OUT YOU HAD SEX WITH MY BOYFRIEND. I DIDN'T COME BACK FOR YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK,BLAIR'S MY BEST FRIEND,AND YOU'RE HER BOYFRIEND,
	<br>
	<br>	AND SHE LOVES YOU. YOU'D REALLY GO OUT WITH SOME GUY YOU DON'T KNOW?
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,HE CAN'T BE WORSE THAN THE GUYS I DO KNOW. IF YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS WORLD,JENNY,
	<br>
	<br>	YOU NEED TO DECIDE IF ALL THIS IS WORTH IT.
	<br>	(Jenny) GET OFF. STOP.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY! THAT IS MY LITTLE SISTER!
	<br>
	<br>	BENDEL'S IS INTERESTED IN CARRYING MY LINE.
	<br>
	<br>	'CAUSE MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE LIKE YOU,MOTHER.
	<br>
	<br>	ELEANOR WALDORF IS GEARING UP TO TAKE HER COMPANY PUBLIC,
	<br>
	<br>	AND I'VE BEEN COURTING HER FOR MONTHS
	<br>
	<br>	TO LET ME HANDLE THE DEAL. THEN YOU SHOULD GET IT.
	<br>
	<br>	I WILL GET IT,IF YOU JUST HELP ME OUT A LITTLE BIT.
	<br>
	<br>	SPOTTED--S. AND LONELY BOY MACKING IN THE MEAT PACKING.
	<br>
	<br>	OPPOSITES DO ATTRACT,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT FOR HOW LONG?
	<br>
	<br>	AND WHO AM I?
	<br>
	<br>	THAT'S A SECRET I'LL NEVER TELL.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW YOU LOVE ME.
	<br>
	<br>	X.O.X.O.,GOSSIP GIRL.

	<br>
	<br>	LONG AGO,WHEN EUROPEAN ROYALS GREW BORED WITH PALACE BALLS,
	<br>
	<br>	THEY TOOK A PAGE FROM THE PEONS AND ADDED SOME PAGEANTRY.
	<br>
	<br>	COUTURE AND CANAPéS ARE JUST ANOTHER SATURDAY NIGHT
	<br>
	<br>	UNTIL YOU ADD A MASK,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT PREPARING FOR A BALL IS AN EVENT IN ITSELF,
	<br>
	<br>	WHICH IS WHY QUEENS INVENTED HANDMAIDENS.
	<br>
	<br>	SO THE DRESSES SHOULD BE DELIVERED,
	<br>
	<br>	AND I'LL TAKE THE SMALL STUFF WITH ME. WHICH ONE'S YOURS?
	<br>
	<br>	OH,NO. I'M JUST HELPING BLAIR,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT I MEAN,YOU KNOW,WE'LL SEE.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,HERE'S HOPING.
	<br>
	<br>	WE'LL PUT IT ON BLAIR'S TAB. OH,NO,NO,NO.
	<br>
	<br>	THE GIRLS AT THAT PARTY ARE MY BEST CUSTOMERS.
	<br>
	<br>	WHY NOT SHOW OFF MY LATEST WARES?
	<br>
	<br>	JUST RETURN IT AFTER THE BALL.
	<br>
	<br>	SO KATI MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT A CUSTOM-MADE CORSET,
	<br>
	<br>	AND I HEAR THERE ARE WIGS INVOLVED?
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S A MASQUERADE. YOU HAVE TO CONCEAL YOUR IDENTITY,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT I DO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL PLANNED FOR NATE TONIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S A GAME. IT'S A SCAVENGER HUNT.
	<br>
	<br>	NATE STARTS THE NIGHT WITH A CLUE,WHICH LEADS HIM
	<br>
	<br>	TO A LADY-IN-WAITING,WHO GIVES HIM A CLUE TO THE NEXT LADY-- WAIT. HOLD ON. YOU HAVE LADIES NOW?
	<br>
	<br>	IF HE FINDS ME BEFORE MIDNIGHT WHEN THE MASKS COME OFF,
	<br>
	<br>	HE CAN CLAIM HIS PRIZE. AND WHAT'S THAT?
	<br>
	<br>	OH. YEAH,RIGHT. SORRY.
	<br>
	<br>	I JUST FIGURED
	<br>
	<br>	THAT AFTER EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED,
	<br>
	<br>	OR HASN'T HAPPENED,
	<br>
	<br>	I SHOULD FIND SOME WAY TO MAKE IT SPECIAL.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,THAT'S REALLY ROMANTIC,BLAIR.
	<br>
	<br>	REALLY.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK,UM,IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO COME TONIGHT,
	<br>
	<br>	I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. I COULD JUST--
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT? NO,I WANT YOU TO COME.
	<br>
	<br>	IN FACT,I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD BE ONE OF MY LADIES.
	<br>
	<br>	WOULD YOU GIVE NATE THE LAST CLUE?
	<br>
	<br>	ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT ME TO?
	<br>
	<br>	TONIGHT IS ALL ABOUT STARTING OVER.
	<br>
	<br>	I TRUST YOU... AND HIM.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,THEN I WILL BE HONORED TO SERVE YOU,MY QUEEN.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,BESIDES,YOU'RE BRINGING DAN,RIGHT?
	<br>
	<br>	A BALL? HAVEN'T YOU HEARD? YOUR SISTER'S CINDERELLA.
	<br>
	<br>	AND LET ME GUESS. YOUR WICKED STEPSISTER IS BLAIR WALDORF.
	<br>
	<br>	BLAIR MAY HAVE ASKED ME TO DO A FEW THINGS,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT I'M HAPPY TO HELP. AND IF SHE HAPPENS TO HELP YOU OUT WITH AN INVITE AND OUTFIT?
	<br>
	<br>	IT'LL ALL BE WORTH IT. EVERYONE IN DISGUISE
	<br>
	<br>	IN THIS OLD BALLROOM-- IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING. YOU KNOW,
	<br>
	<br>	I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED SERENA DIDN'T MENTION IT. WHY? WE'VE ONLY BEEN OUT TWICE.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S NOT LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN,
	<br>
	<br>	WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT,WELL I GOTTA GO DELIVER THIS STUFF.
	<br>
	<br>	LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ME TO PICK YOU UP A TUX.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT? IT'S A MASKED BALL.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M SURE SHE THINKS I'D NEVER GO TO SOMETHING THAT PRETENTIOUS,
	<br>
	<br>	WHICH SHOWS SHE KNOWS ME WELL. I KNOW HIM. A MASKED BALL?
	<br>
	<br>	DAN WOULD NEVER WANT TO GO TO SOMETHING THAT PRETENTIOUS,
	<br>
	<br>	WHERE HE HAS TO WEAR A MASK AND A TUX?
	<br>
	<br>	HE LIKES YOU. HE WOULD WEAR A TUX AND A MASK
	<br>
	<br>	AND ONE OF MY MOTHER'S DRESSES
	<br>
	<br>	IF IT MEANT THAT HE COULD GO OUT WITH YOU. COME ON.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT,ARE YOU WORRIED THAT HE ALREADY HAS A DATE?
	<br>
	<br>	I MEAN,HE IS DAN HUMPHREY. (chuckles) SHUT UP. I DON'T KNOW.
	<br>
	<br>	I GUESS A MASKED BALL IS BETTER THAN A REGULAR PARTY
	<br>
	<br>	BECAUSE THEN ALL THOSE KIDS FROM SCHOOL THAT HE HATES--
	<br>
	<br>	HE WON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THEM. ALL RIGHT. INVITE HIM. I INSIST.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M NOT SAYING I WOULDN'T GO.
	<br>
	<br>	IF SERENA ASKED ME,I WOULDN'T DEPRIVE HER OF MY COMPANY.
	<br>
	<br>	NO,THAT WOULD BE TOO CRUEL.
	<br>
	<br>	BUT SHE HASN'T ASKED ME,SO...
	<br>
	<br>	IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH HER,JUST MAKE IT HAPPEN.
	<br>
	<br>	PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE. THIS THING HAPPENS IN A MATTER OF HOURS.
	<br>
	<br>	THE WINDOW FOR BOLD GESTURES IS OFFICIALLY CLOSED.
	<br>
	<br>	(cell phone rings) IS THAT HER?
	<br>
	<br>	(ring) UH,NO,IT'S VANESSA.
	<br>
	<br>	VANESSA? (ring)
	<br>
	<br>	THAT'S BEEN A WHILE.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU GONNA ANSWER THAT? OF COURSE. WHY WOULDN'T I?
	<br>
	<br>	HELLO? VANESSA.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi. Yeah,it's me.
	<br>
	<br>	SO WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UP? HOW'S VERMONT?
	<br>
	<br>	Do you still have my copy of "The Crying of Lot 49"?
	<br>
	<br>	UM,I DON'T KNOW.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,could you check?
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY. I HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOU IN OVER A YEAR,
	<br>
	<br>	AND YOU CALLED TO ASK ME ABOUT AN OLD BOOK?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW,IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.
	<br>
	<br>	TRY OVER BY THE WINDOW. (giggles)
	<br>
	<br>	VANESSA. SURPRISE!
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT? OH,MY GOD.
	<br>
	<br>	HOW ARE YOU? SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? MY PARENTS SAID I COULD LIVE WITH MY SISTER
	<br>
	<br>	AND FINISH HIGH SCHOOL IN THE CITY. SO--SO THAT MEANS YOU'RE--
	<br>
	<br>	I'M BACK FOR GOOD.
	<br>
	<br>	WOW. WOW.
	<br>
	<br>	THAT IS...
	<br>
	<br>	AWESOME,I HOPE?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,T-TOTALLY. YES,OF COURSE.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S JUST... UNEXPECTED.
	<br>
	<br>	UNEXPECTEDLY AWESOME.
	<br>
	<br>	GO AHEAD. ANSWER THAT. I'M STARVING,AND I SMELL WAFFLES.
	<br>
	<br>	(Vanessa) RUFUS. (Rufus) VANESSA.
	<br>
	<br>	HI. SERENA,HEY.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY. HI.
	<br>
	<br>	(Blair) Go ahead. Do it.
	<br>
	<br>	UH,HEY,I WAS JUST WONDERING,
	<br>
	<br>	ARE YOU,UH,ARE YOU,UH,DOING ANYTHING TONIGHT?
	<br>
	<br>	TONIGHT? NO. NO,NOTHING. WHY?
	<br>
	<br>	GOOD,BECAUSE THERE'S THIS THING,
	<br>
	<br>	AND YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA THINK IT'S STUPID,BUT... TRY ME.
	<br>
	<br>	EVEN COLD,THESE ARE SO GOOD.
	<br>
	<br>	I-I'VE MISSED RUFUS' COOKING. I HAVE.
	<br>
	<br>	(Vanessa) Rufus,do you have whipped cream? WHO'S THAT?
	<br>
	<br>	UH,IT'S... IT'S MY SISTER,
	<br>
	<br>	But you--you were saying something.
	<br>
	<br>	HI,BLAIR. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO WITH THIS STUFF? OH,JUST LEAVE THEM OVER THERE.
	<br>
	<br>	THAT'S FINE. I LEFT YOU ANOTHER LIST.
	<br>
	<br>	Is anyone there? Hello?
	<br>
	<br>	I'M SORRY. UH... WHAT?
	<br>
	<br>	UH,YOU--YOU WERE ASKING ME SOMETHING.
	<br>
	<br>	NO,UH...
	<br>
	<br>	No,never mind.
	<br>
	<br>	THANK YOU. HAVE A GOOD DAY. OKAY.
	<br>
	<br>	BYE. (shuts phone)
	<br>
	<br>	SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TONIGHT?
	<br>
	<br>	I THINK I NEED A DATE.
	<br>
	<br>	DAMN IT,ANNE,I TOLD YOU NO STARCH.
	<br>
	<br>	HOWARD,WE'VE BEEN GOING TO THE SAME CLEANERS FOR 19 YEARS.
	<br>
	<br>	YOUR SHIRTS ARE EXACTLY HOW THEY ALWAYS ARE.
	<br>
	<br>	WE BOTH KNOW THIS ISN'T ABOUT LAUNDRY. I'M SORRY,BUT I NEED EVERYTHING
	<br>
	<br>	TO BE PERFECT AT ELEANOR'S PARTY TONIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	I CAN'T SCREW UP. ELEANOR KNOWS YOU'RE THE BEST PERSON
	<br>
	<br>	TO TAKE HER COMPANY PUBLIC. SHE'S GOING TO PICK YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	JUST SHOW UP AND BE YOURSELF.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK,I'M GONNA CALL YOU FROM THE OFFICE.
	<br>
	<br>	I GOTTA LOOK OVER THE PROPOSAL AGAIN.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY,MOM.
	<br>
	<br>	OH,NATE.
	<br>
	<br>	IS EVERYTHING OKAY WITH DAD?
	<br>
	<br>	JUST WORK STUFF. NOTHING FOR YOU TO WORRY ABOUT.
	<br>
	<br>	SURE.
	<br>
	<br>	GOD! I LOVE NEW YORK.
	<br>
	<br>	THERE WAS ONLY ONE THEATER IN WOODBURY,
	<br>
	<br>	AND ALL IT EVER PLAYED WERE FAMILY MOVIES.
	<br>
	<br>	"THE PACIFIER" PLAYED FOR,LIKE,A YEAR.
	<br>
	<br>	AND THEY SAID VIN DIESEL COULDN'T DO COMEDY. (laughs)
	<br>
	<br>	I CAN'T PICK. OVERWHELMED BY CHOICE.
	<br>
	<br>	WHATEVER YOU WANT.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,SURE,WHATEVER. YOU DO WANNA DO SOMETHING,RIGHT?
	<br>
	<br>	I MEAN,YOU DON'T HAVE PLANS.
	<br>
	<br>	BIG NIGHT OUT WITH OVERPRIVILEGED,UNDER-PARENTED
	<br>
	<br>	TRUST FUND BRATS FROM YOUR FANCY SCHOOL?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,THE LIMO'S ACTUALLY WAITING BACK AT THE LOFT.
	<br>
	<br>	GOOD. WE CAN EGG IT. MAYBE SLASH THE TIRES? (chuckles)
	<br>
	<br>	SO IS IT WEIRD,HAVING ME BACK?
	<br>
	<br>	NO. WHY,UH,WHY-- WHY WOULD IT BE WEIRD?
	<br>
	<br>	BECAUSE WE SAID SOME THINGS THE NIGHT THAT I LEFT--
	<br>
	<br>	THINGS THAT YOU IMMEDIATELY ASKED ME TO TAKE BACK.
	<br>
	<br>	BECAUSE I WAS LEAVING,BUT... NOW I'M HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,AND IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR,YOU KNOW?
	<br>
	<br>	A LOT HAS HAPPENED,ACTUALLY.
	<br>
	<br>	AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT IT TONIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	LATE SHOW. ANGELIKA? WHATEVER'S PLAYING?
	<br>
	<br>	UNLESS IT'S "THE PACIFIER." UNLESS IT'S "THE PACIFIER." (laughs)
	<br>
	<br>	ALL RIGHT. I'LL GET TICKETS.
	<br>
	<br>	GLAD TO BE HOME,HUMPHREY.
	<br>
	<br>	GLAD TO HAVE YOU,ABRAMS.
	<br>
	<br>	(Chuck) SO WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
	<br>
	<br>	EVIDENCE.
	<br>
	<br>	OF WHAT?
	<br>
	<br>	THE CAPTAIN'S DISLIKE OF STARCHY SHIRTS?
	<br>
	<br>	I TOTALLY SYMPATHIZE. THE COLLARS CHAFE.
	<br>
	<br>	DID YOU,UH,ASK HIM ABOUT YOUR MISSING COLLEGE MONEY?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,HE SAID HE WAS MOVING ACCOUNTS AROUND.
	<br>
	<br>	IT WAS ALL BACK THE NEXT DAY. SO WHY WORRY? MYSTERIOUS FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS,
	<br>
	<br>	WARRING PARENTS. WELCOME TO THE UPPER EAST SIDE.
	<br>
	<br>	"CHI CHI,GET THE LLELLO." NATHANIEL,I'M SHOCKED.
	<br>
	<br>	I THOUGHT YOU WERE STRICTLY AN HERBAL MAN.
	<br>
	<br>	THIS ISN'T MINE.
	<br>
	<br>	WHO DOES THIS DAN HUMPHREY THINK HE IS?
	<br>
	<br>	SERENA IS PUTTING UP ATRONG FRONT,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT I CAN SEE HOW HURT SHE IS.
	<br>
	<br>	WE HAVE TO HELP HER HEAL HER HEART. BUT IT'S PRETTY LATE NOTICE.
	<br>
	<br>	MOST OF THE GOOD ONES ARE ALREADY TAKEN. NO MORE EXCUSES. SERENA MUST HAVE THE HOTTEST DATE EVER.
	<br>
	<br>	IF HE'S GOT PLANS,HE'LL CHANGE THEM.
	<br>
	<br>	IF HE'S GOT A GIRLFRIEND,HE'LL DUMP HER,
	<br>
	<br>	AND IF HE'S OUT OF TOWN,HE'LL CHARTER A G5 AND FLY HOME.
	<br>
	<br>	MAKE IT HAPPEN.
	<br>
	<br>	(man) DO YOU LIKE IT? THAT'S OUTSTANDING. (gasps)
	<br>
	<br>	IS IT A BONG,MOTHER?
	<br>
	<br>	PLEASE. I DIDN'T TAKE YOU FOR A STONER.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S A... A HOOKAH... MM-HMM.
	<br>
	<br>	AND IT IS ADORABLE. IT'S PERFECT FOR MY MOROCCAN-THEMED PARTY.
	<br>
	<br>	WHY DO YOU HAVE TO CELEBRATE YOUR BENDEL'S DEAL
	<br>
	<br>	BY TURNING OUR PENTHOUSE INTO AN OPIUM DEN?
	<br>
	<br>	WHY NOT? (laughs)
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,it's Blair.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry I can't come to the phone right now,
	<br>
	<br>	but I'm getting ready for the masked ball.
	<br>
	<br>	See you tonight,if you recognize me,which you won't. (beep)
	<br>
	<br>	HEY,BLAIR. IT'S ME. I,UM...
	<br>
	<br>	I JUST-- I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S,UH,THERE'S THIS THING WITH MY DAD,
	<br>
	<br>	AND,UM...
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW,I JUST-- I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	SO CAN YOU CALL ME BACK WHEN YOU CAN? THANKS.
	<br>
	<br>	(sighs) WELL,THAT'S ALL OF IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
	<br>
	<br>	I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE WITHOUT YOU. THANK YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	THAT'S OKAY. YEAH,IT WAS FUN.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M GLAD. IT'S ALL PART OF YOUR EDUCATION.
	<br>
	<br>	AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE LEARNING. IT'S A NICE BRACELET.
	<br>
	<br>	VINTAGE,RIGHT? THE DIAMONDS LOOK REAL.
	<br>
	<br>	'CAUSE THEY SORT OF ARE.
	<br>
	<br>	UH,THE MAN AT THE STORE LENT IT TO ME.
	<br>
	<br>	WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
	<br>
	<br>	OH! OH,SWEETIE,YOU DIDN'T THINK
	<br>
	<br>	YOU WERE GONNA BE ABLE TO COME TONIGHT,RIGHT?
	<br>
	<br>	I THOUGHT MAYBE,YEAH.
	<br>
	<br>	JENNY,FRESHMEN DON'T GET TO GO TO THE MASKED BALL.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S JUST TRADITION. NO,I KNOW. IT'S JUST THAT THERE WERE FIVE DRESSES.
	<br>
	<br>	OH,IT-- YOU ALWAYS NEED BACKUP.
	<br>
	<br>	I MEAN,WHAT--WHAT IF I SPILLED SOMETHING OR A ZIPPER BROKE?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,OF COURSE. I'LL--I'LL REMEMBER THAT.
	<br>
	<br>	HAVE FUN TONIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	I WILL,AND DON'T WORRY,
	<br>
	<br>	YOUR TIME WILL COME. I PROMISE.
	<br>
	<br>	NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,I HAVE TO GET READY.
	<br>
	<br>	DO YOU THINK THAT ELEANOR WALDORF
	<br>
	<br>	WILL FIND THIS... NIGHT IN TANGIERS ENOUGH?
	<br>
	<br>	MAYBE IF YOU BROUGHT A GOAT.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW,ELEANOR ALWAYS GOES ALL-OUT. SPEAKING OF GOING ALL-OUT...
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,I KNOW. TELL ME ABOUT IT. I DON'T THINK THE WALDORF WOMEN
	<br>
	<br>	EVER MET A THEME THEY DIDN'T JUST LOVE.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU GOING WITH DAN?
	<br>
	<br>	UM,NO,DAN HAS PLANS,ACTUALLY. DOING WHAT?
	<br>
	<br>	THE QUESTION IS "WITH WHOM?"
	<br>
	<br>	OH,I DIDN'T REALIZE.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,FRANKLY,I AM RELIEVED.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW,AT YOUR AGE,YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING THE FIELD.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT ABOUT AT YOUR AGE? YOU GOT A HOT DATE TONIGHT?
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT? NO,PLEASE. WHO WOULD I BE DATING?
	<br>
	<br>	(I.M. alert dings) YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA GO TRY THIS ON
	<br>
	<br>	AND SEE IF I CAN FIND A GOAT.

	<br>
	<br>	SO,UH,WE'RE GETTING TICKETS ONLINE. CALL ME BACK.
	<br>
	<br>	WHY IS IT THAT FRIENDS OF SERENA VAN DER WOODSEN
	<br>
	<br>	HAVEO SEARCH FOR HER SUITOR?
	<br>
	<br>	HAVE FABLES FALLEN SO OUT OF FASHION
	<br>
	<br>	THAT THE PRINCESSES HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING THEMSELVES?
	<br>
	<br>	CALL US OLD-SCHOOL,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT SOMETIMES THE FAIRY-TALE ENDING
	<br>
	<br>	REQUIRES THE KNIGHT TO GET OFF HIS ASS
	<br>
	<br>	AND SADDLE UP HIS STEED.
	<br>
	<br>	So...What are we doing tonight?
	<br>
	<br>	(Dan) MAYBE IT'S NEVER TOO LATE FOR A BOLD GESTURE.
	<br>
	<br>	Got a mask?

	<br>	I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. IT'S,UM,DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,OF COURSE.
	<br>
	<br>	COME IN.
	<br>
	<br>	THANKS.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH.
	<br>
	<br>	MAYBE IT'S OLD. YOU KNOW,LEFT OVER FROM THE '90s OR SOMETHING,
	<br>
	<br>	FROM SOME NIGHT AT LIMELIGHT OR THE TUNNEL?
	<br>
	<br>	OUR PARENTS DID WAY WORSE STUFF THAN WE DO.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S NOT OLD,AND IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE.
	<br>
	<br>	I THINK HE'S HAVING SOME MONEY PROBLEMS.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,HAVE YOU ASKED HIM ABOUT IT?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH.
	<br>
	<br>	I JUST WISH,YOU KNOW,I WISH HE'D BE HONEST WITH ME.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S LIKE HE AND MY MOM--
	<br>
	<br>	THEY MADE SOME SECRET PACT TO ACT LIKE ROBOTS.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,WELL,I DON'T THINK THAT PACT IS SO SECRET.
	<br>
	<br>	I THINK ALL OF OUR PARENTS SIGNED IT. BUT I'M NOT A LITTLE KID ANYMORE.
	<br>
	<br>	HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SHUT ME OUT.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK,IF WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT,
	<br>
	<br>	HE'S PROBABLY REALLY SCARED.
	<br>
	<br>	MAYBE YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL MORE THAN ONCE
	<br>
	<br>	FOR HIM TO REALLY HEAR YOU,YOU KNOW?
	<br>
	<br>	HEY,DON'T GIVE UP,OKAY?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW,I'VE GOTTA GET READY AND STUFF.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,ME,TOO. UM...
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK,THANKS FOR JUST LISTENING.
	<br>
	<br>	THAT'S FINE. YEAH,DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
	<br>
	<br>	CHUCK JUST WANTED A BUMP,AND BLAIR'S PHONE
	<br>
	<br>	WAS TURNED OFF,SO IT,UM,REALLY MEANS A LOT.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,ANYTIME,NATE. I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT,OKAY?
	<br>
	<br>	ALL RIGHT. I'LL SEE YA. BYE.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY,ANYBODY HOME?
	<br>
	<br>	HEY,YOU AND DAN GOING OUT?
	<br>
	<br>	JUST TO THE MOVIES. WHAT ABOUT YOU?
	<br>
	<br>	A HUMPHREY MAN IN A SPORTS COAT?
	<br>
	<br>	I'D NORMALLY ASK IF YOU HAD A DATE,BUT-- BUT MY WIFE LEFT ME,HMM?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH. WHAT'S UP WITH ALISON? DAN SAYS SHE'S STILL UPSTATE.
	<br>
	<br>	I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST FOR THE SUMMER. SO DID HER HUSBAND.
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY,WE'LL CIRCLE BACK TO THAT.
	<br>
	<br>	ONE ISSUE AT A TIME. LIKE WHERE ARE MY KEYS?
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT DO YOU NEED KEYS FOR? JUST USE DAN'S WINDOW.
	<br>
	<br>	WHERE IS DAN,BY THE WAY?
	<br>
	<br>	UH,HE SHOULD BE BACK IN A MINUTE. HMM.
	<br>
	<br>	SO,UH,DAN SEEMS HAPPY TO SEE YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	WHY WOULDN'T HE BE?
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,UM,IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING SO,
	<br>
	<br>	WHEN YOU LEFT HERE,YOU KIND OF BROKE HIS HEART.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M BACK,AREN'T I?
	<br>
	<br>	I HATED BEING AWAY FROM THE CITY..
	<br>
	<br>	AWAY FROM DAN.
	<br>
	<br>	DID YOU TELL DAN THIS?
	<br>
	<br>	NO,NOT YET,BUT I'M PLANNING ON IT TONIGHT--
	<br>
	<br>	BEFORE OR AFTER THE MOVIE. I'M NOT SURE YET.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW,I GOTTA PICK MY MOMENT.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL.
	<br>
	<br>	HMM.
	<br>
	<br>	OH,THANKS.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW,THERE'S,UH,
	<br>
	<br>	A LOT THAT'S CHANGED SINCE YOU WERE HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	SO DAN SAYS.
	<br>
	<br>	BUT YOU GUYS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CLOSE.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
	<br>
	<br>	WISH ME LUCK?
	<br>
	<br>	ME,TOO.
	<br>
	<br>	WHERE ARE YOU GOING ANYWAY? UH,JUST SOME PARTY.
	<br>
	<br>	WITH A FRIEND? (cell phone rings)
	<br>
	<br>	I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL HER THAT. (ring)
	<br>
	<br>	SEE YA.
	<br>
	<br>	HELLO?
	<br>
	<br>	HEY. WHERE ARE YOU? AT YOUR HOUSE.
	<br>
	<br>	OH. OH,YOU'RE EARLY.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,I JUST COULDN'T WAIT.
	<br>
	<br>	OH,UM,I TRIED TO GET YOU BEFORE YOU LEFT.
	<br>
	<br>	I-I FEEL TERRIBLE.
	<br>
	<br>	'CAUSE I'M EARLY?
	<br>
	<br>	NO,BECAUSE,UM,I... I TOTALLY SPACED.
	<br>
	<br>	I HAVE THIS,UH,
	<br>
	<br>	AMERICAN HISTORY PAPER DUE MONDAY.
	<br>
	<br>	SO YOU KNOW,I'LL BE WRITING ALL NIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll make it up to you,though. I promise.
	<br>
	<br>	PIEROGIS AT VESELKA?
	<br>
	<br>	I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.
	<br>
	<br>	JENNY,HEY.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY.
	<br>
	<br>	W--
	<br>
	<br>	JENNY,WHAT'S WRONG?
	<br>
	<br>	AND HOW IS THIS A FAVOR TO ME AGAIN?
	<br>
	<br>	RUFUS,LOOK AROUND. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD ACCESS
	<br>
	<br>	TO THE TOP PEOPLE IN MUSIC AND ART?
	<br>
	<br>	INTRODUCE YOURSELF. REVITALIZE YOUR FLAGGING CAREER.
	<br>
	<br>	PUT THAT SAD LITTLE GALLERY ON THE CULTURAL RADAR.
	<br>
	<br>	SINCE WHEN WERE YOU THE PATRON SAINT OF FORMER ROCK STARS?
	<br>
	<br>	SINCE WHEN WERE YOU A STAR? NO,LOOK,LEAVE IF YOU WANT TO.
	<br>
	<br>	REALLY. ALISON WOULD HAVE A FIT
	<br>
	<br>	IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE ACCOMPANYING ME TO THIS PARTY,
	<br>
	<br>	EVEN IF IT WAS FOR YOUR BENEFIT. ACTUALLY,I DON'T CARE WHAT ALISON THINKS RIGHT NOW.
	<br>
	<br>	GOOD. THEN LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR HOSTESS.
	<br>
	<br>	ELEANOR.
	<br>
	<br>	IT IS DIVINE. SQUINT,AND IT'S MARRAKECH.
	<br>
	<br>	(laughs) LILY.
	<br>
	<br>	I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE BRINGING A DATE.
	<br>
	<br>	HOW DELIGHTFUL. OH,THIS IS RUFUS HUMPHREY.
	<br>
	<br>	OH,IT'S NOT A DATE. OH,PLEASURE.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S NOT A DATE. MM-HMM.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK. APPETIZERS. IS THAT COUSCOUS?
	<br>
	<br>	(Eleanor) YES,PLEASE.
	<br>
	<br>	(Bart) HEY. (Eleanor) BART!
	<br>
	<br>	HI.
	<br>
	<br>	AND FRIEND.
	<br>
	<br>	HI.
	<br>
	<br>	OH. MM. SOMETHING CATCH YOUR EYE?
	<br>
	<br>	(whispers) OH,I LIKE HER OUTFIT. LILY.
	<br>
	<br>	BART.
	<br>
	<br>	HELLO.
	<br>
	<br>	HI.
	<br>
	<br>	I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET CARISSA. YEAH,HI. CARISSA.
	<br>
	<br>	HI.
	<br>
	<br>	HI. RUFUS. HI,RUFUS.
	<br>
	<br>	(Rufus) YEAH,HI. WELL,IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	GREAT TO SEE YOU. ENJOY.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU,TOO. OKAY.
	<br>
	<br>	MM.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU AND BART BASS? SUDDENLY IT ALL MAKES SENSE.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU BROUGHT ME HERE TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS. OH,DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
	<br>
	<br>	I MEAN,IT'S FLATTERING,I GUESS,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT COULDN'T YOU HAVE DONE A LITTLE BETTER? OH,NOT ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.
	<br>
	<br>	ELEANOR,OH! AS-SALAAMU ALAIKUM.
	<br>
	<br>	OH! HOW ARE YOU? THIS IS FANTASTIC.
	<br>
	<br>	THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. GOD BLESS YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	SO THIS BLAIR GIRL USED YOU AS HER SLAVE?
	<br>
	<br>	NO,I WAS HER HANDMAIDEN. "HANDMAIDEN" IS JANE AUSTEN FOR "SLAVE."
	<br>
	<br>	SHE NEVER ACTUALLY SAID I WOULD GET TO GO TO THE BALL,
	<br>
	<br>	EVEN IF I DID ALL THOSE ERRANDS. UNH-UNH. DON'T MAKE EXCUSES FOR HER.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU DID ALL THAT STUFF. YOU DESERVE TO GO. I THOUGHT YOU SAID
	<br>
	<br>	THAT MASKED BALLS ARE "TOTALLY PRETENTIOUS." ONE WOMAN'S OPINION.
	<br>
	<br>	BUT IF YOU WANNA GO,NO BLAIR SHOULD KEEP YOU AWAY.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S NOT JUST BLAIR. I MEAN,I DON'T HAVE A GOWN. MY FRIEND WORKS
	<br>
	<br>	IN THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT AT B.A.M.
	<br>
	<br>	WE CAN BORROW ONE. NEXT? I DON'T HAVE AN INVITATION.
	<br>
	<br>	EVERY BALLROOM HAS A BACK DOOR. WHAT ELSE?
	<br>
	<br>	IF BLAIR SAW ME,SHE'D BE FURIOUS.
	<br>
	<br>	THEN IT'S A GOOD THING YOU'LL BE WEARING A MASK.
	<br>
	<br>	ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE, APPEARANCES
	<br>
	<br>	ARE OFTEN DECEIVING. FROM FRIENDS TO HAIR COLOR,
	<br>
	<br>	THERE'S ALWAYS MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE.
	<br>
	<br>	IS UPTOWN THIS WAY OR THAT WAY?
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S,UH,THAT WAY,
	<br>
	<br>	AND THESE THINGS WHIZZING BY HERE--THEY'RE CARS.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU MIGHWANT TO AVOID THEM. YOU KNOW WHAT?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU'LL SEE BETTER WITHOUT THIS,TOO. WHOA. THAT IS BETTER.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY,YOU GOT A NAME?
	<br>
	<br>	JACK ALTMAN.
	<br>
	<br>	HI. JACK ALTMAN. I JUST STEPPED OUT FOR SOME AIR.
	<br>
	<br>	ALTMAN? OKAY.
	<br>
	<br>	COME ON. (Vanessa) THANK YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	WAIT. LET ME SEE.
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY,LOOK,I KNOW YOU'RE COMPLETELY MORALLY OPPOSED
	<br>
	<br>	TO SOCIETY EVENTS AND STUFF,BUT--
	<br>
	<br>	WE'LL DEPROGRAM YOU LATER. THIS IS UGLY.
	<br>
	<br>	JUST GO.
	<br>
	<br>	ALL RIGHT. THANKS.
	<br>
	<br>	THANK YOU SO MUCH. ANYTIME.
	<br>
	<br>	(Gossip Girl) WHAT WAS IT WE SAID ABOUT APPEARANCES?
	<br>
	<br>	YES,THEY CAN BE DECEIVING.
	<br>
	<br>	BUT MOST OF THE TIME, WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY.
	<br>
	<br>	HAVE YOU SEEN THAT GIRL I WAS WITH?
	<br>
	<br>	WHEN I GRABBED HER BAG,I GOT HER HOUSE KEYS,TOO.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT IS NATE DOING?
	<br>
	<br>	HE'S SUPPOSED TO GO FIND KATI AND IS.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S GETTING LATE,AND I'M LOSING HEAT. WELL,YOU LOOK RAVISHING.
	<br>
	<br>	IF I WERE YOUR MAN,I WOULDN'T NEED CLUES TO FIND YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	OR TO RAVISH ME,I'M SURE. WHO IS THAT?
	<br>
	<br>	(Blair) PROBABLY SOME BITCH FROM CHAPIN.
	<br>
	<br>	HOT BITCH FROM CHAPIN.
	<br>
	<br>	FORGET HER. GO GET NATE. POINT HIM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
	<br>
	<br>	FIRST THINGS FIRST.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,HELLO,ANGEL.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU MUST BE MY LUCKY NIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	AND WITH TASTE TO BOOT.
	<br>
	<br>	APPARENTLY NOT.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M TALKING TO YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	BEAUTIFUL AND MEAN? I'VE GOT CHILLS.
	<br>
	<br>	CARE TO DANCE WITH A POOR DEVIL?
	<br>
	<br>	WHY DON'T WE JUST SKIP ALL THAT AND,UH,
	<br>
	<br>	GO SOMEWHERE QUIET TO TALK?
	<br>
	<br>	I'LL GET THE CHAMPAGNE.
	<br>
	<br>	FIND ME IN FIVE.
	<br>
	<br>	TAKING A COMPANY PUBLIC IS AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY.
	<br>
	<br>	THERE'S NOTHING MORE VALUABLE
	<br>
	<br>	THAN MAKING A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION.
	<br>
	<br>	AND YOU TAUGHT ME THAT,ELEANOR. CAPTAIN,YOU KNOW THAT I ADORE YOU,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT YOU'VE NEVER DONE FASHION BEFORE.
	<br>
	<br>	I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO CALVIN'S PEOPLE,AND I HAVE TO SAY,
	<br>
	<br>	THE PRESENTATION IS VERY IMPRESSIVE. ENOUGH BUSINESS TALK,HOWARD. YOU'RE BORING HER.
	<br>
	<br>	MM. ELEANOR,I'VE BEEN THINKING.
	<br>
	<br>	WHEN NATE AND BLAIR GET ENGAGED,
	<br>
	<br>	SHE SHOULD HAVE MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER'S RING,
	<br>
	<br>	THE ONE THAT CORNELIUS VANDERBILT GAVE HER?
	<br>
	<br>	HUH.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU STILL SPYING ON HIM?
	<br>
	<br>	I'M NOT SPYING. I'M JUST...
	<br>
	<br>	KEEPING TRACK OF HIS WHEREABOUTS.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,SO LONG AS YOU'RE WATCHING,HE'S WINNING.
	<br>
	<br>	IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE A MAN JEALOUS,
	<br>
	<br>	THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO. RUFUS,I INVITED YOU HERE FOR MANY REASONS,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT KNOWLEDGE OF ROMANCE IS NOT...
	<br>
	<br>	THAT WAS,UM...
	<br>
	<br>	UNEXPECTED.
	<br>
	<br>	GIVE HIM 20 MINUTES.
	<br>
	<br>	I NEED A DRINK. I NEED A DRINK.
	<br>
	<br>	SO EVERY TIME WE SEE THEIR YACHT NOW,
	<br>
	<br>	WE JUST PULL OUT OUR AIR HORNS AND LET 'EM RIP.
	<br>
	<br>	(laughs) WOW. I TELL YOU,IT IS ALMOST ENOUGH
	<br>
	<br>	TO MAKE YOU NEVER WANT TO SUMMER IN NEWPORT AGAIN.
	<br>
	<br>	WOW,THAT SOUNDS,UH,AWFUL.
	<br>
	<br>	IT IS. IT'S PRETTY BAD.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,YEAH,UM,YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
	<br>
	<br>	I,UH,I THINK I'M GONNA GO AND-- CHANGE PARTNERS?
	<br>
	<br>	HEY.
	<br>
	<br>	DAN,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M SAVING YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	I DON'T NEED TO BE SAVED. REALLY? 'CAUSE,UH,I COULD SEE YOUR EYES ROLLING
	<br>
	<br>	TO THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD FROM ACROSS THE ROOM. DAN.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY. BLAIR SENT US OVER.
	<br>
	<br>	SHE SAID IT'S GETTING LATE,AND YOU'RE TAKING TOO LONG.
	<br>
	<br>	"YOUR LADY-IN-WAITING IS CLOSER THAN YOU THINK,
	<br>
	<br>	HER HEADDRESS IS FEATHERS OF BLACK AND PINK."
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S HER. IT'S ME.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT? I'M SORRY.
	<br>
	<br>	JUST FIND SERENA.
	<br>
	<br>	SHE'LL LEAD YOU TO BLAIR.
	<br>
	<br>	SERENA. RIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	BOO.
	<br>
	<br>	LET'S PLAY A GAME. I'D SAY STRIP POKER,BUT I DON'T HAVE MY CARDS.
	<br>
	<br>	HOW ABOUT,UH,HIDE-AND-SEEK?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU HIDE. I'LL SEEK.
	<br>
	<br>	AND HOW WILL YOU FIND ME? I DON'T HAVE ANY BREAD CRUMBS.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,YOU CAN LEAVE ME A TRAIL...
	<br>
	<br>	WITH YOUR CLOTHES.
	<br>
	<br>	I HAVE TRULY DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN.
	<br>
	<br>	SO HOW YOU DOING?
	<br>
	<br>	SERENA,WAIT.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT ARE YOU REALLY DOING HERE,DAN?
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT AM I DOING HERE? I RAN ACROSS THE CITY.
	<br>
	<br>	I RENTED A TUXEDO. I STOLE THIS MASK FROM SOME DRUNKEN KID,
	<br>
	<br>	ONLY TO LOOK LIKE ROBIN.
	<br>
	<br>	I CONNED MY WAY IN HERE,ALL TO SEE YOU. I CARE.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,YOU DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE THIS MORNING,
	<br>
	<br>	WHEN YOU WERE WITH ANOTHER GIRL AND LIED TO ME. WHAT? WHOA,WHOA,WHOA,WHOA.
	<br>
	<br>	I-I DIDN'T--WELL... I DID.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH. I DID,BUT I CAN EXPLAIN.
	<br>
	<br>	GO AHEAD. GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.
	<br>
	<br>	I WAS WITH MY FRIEND VANESSA.
	<br>
	<br>	WE'RE VERY CLOSE,AND SHE MOVED AWAY TO VERMONT LAST YEAR,
	<br>
	<br>	AND NOW SHE'S BACK.
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY,SO WHY'D YOU LIE AND SAY IT WAS JENNY?
	<br>
	<br>	BECAUSE I'M AN IDIOT.
	<br>
	<br>	I D--I DON'T KNOW WHY. I...
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK,VANESSA AND I...
	<br>
	<br>	OUR RELATIONSHIP IS A LITTLE COMPLICATED,
	<br>
	<br>	OR IT WAS,BEFORE I MET YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	AND HONESTLY,I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO GET IN THE WAY
	<br>
	<br>	OF YOU INVITING ME TO THIS...
	<br>
	<br>	STUPID PARTY.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,I WAS GONNA INVITE YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	REALLY?
	<br>
	<br>	SO NOT INTO,UH,POMPOUS ASS THE FOURTH?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE NOT INTO OLD FRIEND VANESSA?
	<br>
	<br>	THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING.
	<br>
	<br>	(Gossip Girl) OH,YES,
	<br>
	<br>	THE OTHER PART WE LOVE ABOUT A MASQUERADE?
	<br>
	<br>	WHEN THE MASK FINALLY COMES OFF
	<br>
	<br>	AND THE TRUTH IS REVEALED TO ALL.
	<br>
	<br>	WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?
	<br>
	<br>	I JUST SAW THE LAST PERSON I EVER EXPECTED TO SEE.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH. HOW CAN I SAY NO TO THAT?
	<br>
	<br>	I'M SORRY.
	<br>
	<br>	VANESSA. VANESSA. HEY.
	<br>
	<br>	THIS IS A SURPRISE.
	<br>
	<br>	FUNNY. I COULD SAY THE SAME THING.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M WRITING AN AMERICAN HISTORY PAPER.
	<br>
	<br>	WAIT. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	WHEN DID WE START LYING TO EACH OTHER? I-I MERELY REFRAINED FROM SHARING THE TRUTH,
	<br>
	<br>	WHICH WOULD HAVE SOUNDED A LOT MORE LIKE A LIE
	<br>
	<br>	THAN WHAT I TOLD YOU. HUMPHREY.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M--I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT EITHER,I ADMIT,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT WHAT WAS I GOING TO SAY? THAT I WAS RENTING A TUXEDO
	<br>
	<br>	TO ATTEND A MASKED BALL WITHOUT A MASK OR AN INVITATION
	<br>
	<br>	TO GO GET A GIRL WHO NOT ONLY HAS A MASK AND AN INVITATION,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT ANOTHER DATE? AT LEAST IT'S HONEST.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU--YOU HATE THIS WORLD. SO DO YOU,OR SO I THOUGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	ALL RIGHT,WHAT'S GOING ON EXACTLY?
	<br>
	<br>	DID YOU FOLLOW ME HERE TO PROVE THAT I WAS LYING?
	<br>
	<br>	YES,DAN,THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	I STALKED YOU BECAUSE I AM JUST SO OBSESSED WITH YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	WAIT. DON'T STOP THERE.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU'RE THE WHOLE REASON I CAME BACK TO NEW YORK,
	<br>
	<br>	'CAUSE I JUST COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOU. ALL RIGHT,I GET THE POINT. YOU CAN LAY OFF THE SARCASM--
	<br>
	<br>	HOW ABOUT I LAY OFF THE WHOLE EVENING? BYE. WAIT,WAIT,WAIT,STOP.
	<br>
	<br>	HOLD ON. LISTEN. I'M--I'M SORRY.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M SORRY THAT I LIED ABOUT WRITING A TERM PAPER. YOU SAID YOU LOVE ME.
	<br>
	<br>	LOVED YOU...
	<br>
	<br>	IN THE PAST AND IN A PRESHAVING,16-YEAR-OLD KIND OF WAY.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW,I MEAN,THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
	<br>
	<br>	(voice breaks) CLEARLY.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S TRADED UP.
	<br>
	<br>	SO THAT'S,UM...
	<br>
	<br>	VANESSA,YEAH. SHE'S...
	<br>
	<br>	BEAUTIFUL.
	<br>
	<br>	I-I-I HAVE TO GO AFTER HER. I'M SORRY.
	<br>
	<br>	FEEL FREE TO FIND ME.
	<br>
	<br>	I FOUND YOUR PANTS.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,YOU'RE GETTING WARMER,
	<br>

	<br>	LILY.
	<br>
	<br>	THERE YOU ARE.
	<br>
	<br>	OH,I JUST NEEDED A MOMENT.

	<br>	I'M SORRY I KISSED YOU,BUT I DID IT BECAUSE
	<br>
	<br>	THAT MERCENARY IN THE STARCHED WHITE SHIRT--
	<br>
	<br>	HE DOESN'T APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE
	<br>
	<br>	OVER AN ATTRACTIVE 25-YEAR-OLD MANNEQUIN.
	<br>
	<br>	'CAUSE BEAUTY FADES,
	<br>
	<br>	THOUGH YOURS HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB OF HOLDING ON,
	<br>
	<br>	AND IN THE LONG RUN,IT'S GONNA BE HIS LOSS.
	<br>
	<br>	AND I THOUGHT HE SHOULD KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO LOSE YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	'CAUSE TRUST ME,IT'S NOT FUN.
	<br>
	<br>	I THINK IT WORKED.
	<br>
	<br>	LILY,MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT?
	<br>
	<br>	IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US.
	<br>
	<br>	HAPPY TO HELP.

	<br>
	<br>	I'LL PRETEND DIDN'T HAPPEN TONIGHT. IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
	<br>
	<br>	I'M NOT SURE. DAN SURPRISED ME BY SHOWING UP HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,GO,DAN! YEAH,EXCEPT THEN HE THREW ME FOR A LOOP
	<br>
	<br>	BY CHASING AFTER SOME GIRL NAMED VANESSA.

	<br>
	<br>	REALLY. I MEAN,COME ON. HE'S AT A MASKED BALL,
	<br>
	<br>	AND I THINK HE'D GO BASICALLY ANYWHERE WITH YOU...
	<br>
	<br>	EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THE ICE CAPADES
	<br>
	<br>	'CAUSE THAT REALLY FREAKED HIM OUT WHEN HE WAS 5.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW WHAT? I...
	<br>
	<br>	I THINK I'LL GO AND TRY TO FIND HIM.
	<br>
	<br>	I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA FIND ANYONE.
	<br>
	<br>	THIS STUPID MASK KEEPS FALLING OVER MY EYES.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,I'D GIVE YOU MINE,BUT MASKS COME OFF AT MIDNIGHT,
	<br>
	<br>	AND I KIND OF NEED MY DISGUISE TO GET OUT OF HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU WANNA TRADE?
	<br>
	<br>	SURE.
	<br>
	<br>	THANKS.
	<br>
	<br>	AND HERE,TAKE THIS. IT'S SO HOT IN HERE,
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>	LOOK,I KNOW WE BOTH CARE ABOUT BLAIR,BUT MAYBE
	<br>
	<br>	THE BEST THING IS FOR ME TO JUST TELL HER THE TRUTH.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M NOT OVER YOU,AND I THOUGHT I COULD FIGHT IT,BUT I CAN'T.
	<br>
	<br>	AND IF YOU DON'T STOP ME,I'M GONNA KISS YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	OH!
