<div class="full-script">
	<br>	Gossip girl here
	<br>
	<br>	your one and only source into
	<br>	the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
	<br>
	<br>	How's your mom doing
	<br>	with the divorce and everything?
	<br>
	<br>	So my dad left her
	<br>	for another man.
	<br>
	<br>	She lost 15 pounds,
	<br>	got an eye lift.
	<br>
	<br>	It's been good for her.
	<br>
	<br>	My mom kind of left us
	<br>	a couple months ago.
	<br>
	<br>	My dad and my sister
	<br>	don't really see that.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know what's happened
	<br>	with my wife or my marriage,
	<br>
	<br>	and you showing up here randomly
	<br>	doesn't make figuring that out any easier.
	<br>
	<br>	Am i the only one
	<br>	who thinks this is extremely weird?
	<br>
	<br>	Forget about it.
	<br>
	<br>	If dad can let it go, so can you.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe you didn't tell me
	<br>	your mom came home.
	<br>
	<br>	Your wife despises me.
	<br>
	<br>	- I wouldn't say that.
	<br>	- Well, she did.
	<br>
	<br>	You should deal with your father.
	<br>
	<br>	He needs you.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't.
	<br>
	<br>	We broke up, okay?
	<br>
	<br>	He was gonna get back together with me,
	<br>
	<br>	but only so my mom would help his dad.
	<br>
	<br>	I need your support here, son,
	<br>	and your trust.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, you better hope for your sake
	<br>	they don't call your son to the stand.
	<br>
	<br>	Do you like me?
	<br>
	<br>	Define "like."
	<br>
	<br>	Gossip Girl
	<br>	Season01 Episode09
	<br>
	<br>	As per gossip girl's
	<br>	thanksgiving tradition,
	<br>
	<br>	i'm trading my laptop for stove top,
	<br>
	<br>	and for the next 16 hours,
	<br>	the only thing i'm dishing is seconds.
	<br>
	<br>	When the cat's away,
	<br>	the mice will play.
	<br>
	<br>	Have fun, little rodents.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean, who gets wasted
	<br>	on thanksgiving?
	<br>
	<br>	The holidays are lonely for people.
	<br>
	<br>	I wanted to keep 'em company.
	<br>
	<br>	Whoo!
	<br>
	<br>	THANKSGIVING.
	<br>
	<br>	LAST YEAR.
	<br>
	<br>	your mom is freaking out,
	<br>	so my mom is freaking out.
	<br>
	<br>	What, which means you freak out?
	<br>
	<br>	Blair, just cut the cord.
	<br>	Go nuts.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on.
	<br>	Let's do shots.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on!
	<br>
	<br>	I told lily that you were buying a pie.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, pie.
	<br>
	<br>	Where is your purse?
	<br>
	<br>	- Uh, my purse...
	<br>	- Oh, great. All right.
	<br>
	<br>	You stay here, okay?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm gonna go look.
	<br>
	<br>	Don't drink or hit on anything.
	<br>
	<br>	Pie's been secured.
	<br>
	<br>	Thanksgiving no longer
	<br>	needs to be canceled, all right?
	<br>
	<br>	Um...
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, mom, you know, i need to go.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry.
	<br>	Bye.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, man.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey!
	<br>	What are you doing?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, right of way, pal.
	<br>
	<br>	Screw you, buddy!
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, uh, excu--excuse me.
	<br>
	<br>	D-do you need, like,
	<br>	a crossing guard or a cab maybe?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, pie.
	<br>
	<br>	It's more like roadkill now,
	<br>	but, uh, better it than you, right?
	<br>
	<br>	Um...
	<br>
	<br>	I'm--i'm dan...
	<br>
	<br>	Humphrey.
	<br>
	<br>	- Hi.
	<br>	- Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, i don't know.
	<br>
	<br>	We met last year.
	<br>
	<br>	You m-- you might not remember.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, i--you probably don't,
	<br>	but look, you should be more careful.
	<br>
	<br>	You need to keep your hands off of her.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair!
	<br>
	<br>	Trying to take advantage of her
	<br>	on the holidays.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on.
	<br>	Let's go, serena.
	<br>
	<br>	Bye, dave.
	<br>
	<br>	Bye.
	<br>
	<br>	Bye.
	<br>
	<br>	Bye, serena.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	And hello to you.
	<br>
	<br>	Big national holiday.
	<br>	You excited?
	<br>
	<br>	Kind of am.
	<br>
	<br>	Might be the first thanksgiving
	<br>	in a while that i actually remember.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, i bet.
	<br>
	<br>	Huh?
	<br>
	<br>	Nothing.
	<br>
	<br>	- Uh, you-- uh, you at blair's?
	<br>	- Almost.
	<br>
	<br>	Her dad's gonna be home
	<br>	for the first time since he left,
	<br>
	<br>	so she's really excited.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, well, family reunions
	<br>	are all around then.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, we, too,
	<br>	have a full humphrey household.
	<br>
	<br>	Hopefully, it'll stick.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, it seems like
	<br>	your mom is really trying.
	<br>
	<br>	Better thanksgiving than never.
	<br>
	<br>	Call me between every course?
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	Mwah.Bye.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, is it really okay
	<br>	to cook with this much heavy cream?
	<br>
	<br>	Our arteries give us
	<br>	a free pass on turkey day.
	<br>
	<br>	It's a shame our family doesn't
	<br>	have a few hundred more members.
	<br>
	<br>	Do you think i bought too much?
	<br>
	<br>	Only by several tons.
	<br>
	<br>	But it's our first holiday back.
	<br>
	<br>	I wanted to make sure it was special.
	<br>
	<br>	I think they call that guilt.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, i guess they do.
	<br>
	<br>	But if it means more midnight turkey sandwiches
	<br>	for all of us, then so be it.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, see, dan?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, we on this side of the kitchen
	<br>	choose to be positive.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, dan.
	<br>
	<br>	What's it gonna be?
	<br>
	<br>	You with us or against us?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh...
	<br>
	<br>	Fine.
	<br>
	<br>	But only if i can take
	<br>	the cranberry sauce out of the can.
	<br>
	<br>	That is my specialty.
	<br>
	<br>	I have to find this recipe
	<br>	before my dad gets here.
	<br>
	<br>	Harold waldorf's famous pumpkin pie.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, it may have been bobby flay's,
	<br>
	<br>	but it didn't stop my dad
	<br>	from taking credit for it.
	<br>
	<br>	It's gonna be perfect!
	<br>
	<br>	Look at you.
	<br>
	<br>	Quite the chipper sous-chef.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i'm in a good mood.
	<br>
	<br>	It happens.
	<br>
	<br>	Sometimes 'cause i increase my lexapro,
	<br>
	<br>	sometimes because my dad's in town.
	<br>
	<br>	And sometimes, mostly because
	<br>	things are good with a boy.
	<br>
	<br>	You and nate get back together?
	<br>
	<br>	You mean since gossip girl
	<br>	published pictures of him and some skank?
	<br>
	<br>	So that's a no.
	<br>
	<br>	What's chuck doing today?
	<br>
	<br>	Why are you asking me?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, you guys are friends.
	<br>
	<br>	And, blair, look,
	<br>	you know you can tell me anything.
	<br>
	<br>	I'd be the last person to judge anyone.
	<br>
	<br>	With good reason.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair, i saw you with chuck.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know what i was thinking.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean, sleeping with him once,
	<br>	maybe you could understand, but twice?
	<br>
	<br>	Wait.
	<br>	You slept with him?
	<br>
	<br>	- Shh!
	<br>	- Ugh.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair!
	<br>
	<br>	What happened to no judging?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not, but i thought
	<br>	you wanted to wait.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought you wanted
	<br>	to make things special.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, so nate gets the free pass,
	<br>	and i'm the slut?
	<br>
	<br>	Tell me you didn't
	<br>	sleep with chuck for revenge.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, it wasn't
	<br>	because i like his natural musk,
	<br>
	<br>	and besides, nothing hurts more than
	<br>	sleeping with the best friend, right, s.
	<br>
	<br>	Way to prove a point.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i learned from the master.
	<br>
	<br>	If you're sleeping with chuck,
	<br>	i'd say the student's become the master.
	<br>
	<br>	Are you jealous
	<br>	you didn't get to sleep with him first?
	<br>
	<br>	There had to be somebody
	<br>	left on the upper east side.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair, darling,
	<br>	are you going to help me at all?
	<br>
	<br>	Serena, do you know
	<br>	when your mother's arriving?
	<br>
	<br>	She's not.
	<br>
	<br>	We're not doing thanksgiving
	<br>	here anymore.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh.
	<br>
	<br>	Why?
	<br>
	<br>	Because i uninvited them.
	<br>
	<br>	Happy holidays, eleanor.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, i know it'sy fault that
	<br>	we're here, but let's not get crazy.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i don't know
	<br>	what you're complaining about.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm just trying to
	<br>	provide my family with a home-cooked meal.
	<br>
	<br>	You don't know how to cook.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, don't blame me.
	<br>
	<br>	Talk to your sister.
	<br>
	<br>	She's the one that got us
	<br>	exiled from the waldorfs.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, i'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	And even if you did cook,
	<br>	we don't have an oven.
	<br>
	<br>	Preaching to the converted, eric.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, we'll just pick up
	<br>	a few things and try to make do.
	<br>
	<br>	Like peking duck on thanksgiving.
	<br>
	<br>	Not a bad idea.
	<br>
	<br>	No, mom.
	<br>
	<br>	All the other shops are closed.
	<br>
	<br>	There's nothing wrong with
	<br>	having chinese food on thanksgiving.
	<br>
	<br>	What?
	<br>
	<br>	Jews having been doing it
	<br>	on christmas since forever.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, a pumpkin.
	<br>
	<br>	Isn't this...
	<br>
	<br>	This is festive, yes?
	<br>
	<br>	We're gonna eat a pumpkin?
	<br>
	<br>	Mom.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh.
	<br>
	<br>	So you couldn't
	<br>	make it past the salad, huh?
	<br>
	<br>	I opened the cranberries.
	<br>
	<br>	My work is done.
	<br>
	<br>	How's blair's?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, i wouldn't know.
	<br>
	<br>	She gave me the boot.
	<br>
	<br>	Wh--she kicked you out of her house?
	<br>
	<br>	What happened now?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, don't ask,
	<br>
	<br>	but the good news is,
	<br>	my mom is gonna slice us up a pumpkin.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, and there's duck.
	<br>
	<br>	No, no, no.
	<br>
	<br>	You can't eat duck and raw pumpkin
	<br>	on thanksgiving.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, you know what?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm the guardian of vanessa's sister's van
	<br>	for the weekend,
	<br>
	<br>	and we here at the humphrey manor
	<br>	have an oddly large kitchen table.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you suggesting?
	<br>
	<br>	These smell great.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, so we can starve
	<br>	in a fragrant hotel room.
	<br>
	<br>	We're not starving.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, i got us into this mess,
	<br>	so i'm gonna get us out of it.
	<br>
	<br>	Elaborate, serena.
	<br>
	<br>	Thanksgiving at the humphreys.
	<br>
	<br>	Dan invited me,
	<br>
	<br>	and eric's friends with his sister,
	<br>	and his dad's really cool.
	<br>
	<br>	Awesome.
	<br>	I'm leaving the pumpkin.
	<br>
	<br>	What do you say, mom?
	<br>
	<br>	THANKSGIVING.
	<br>
	<br>	THANKSGIVING.
	<br>	LAST YEAR.
	<br>
	<br>	???
	<br>
	<br>	Sous-chef, you're needed.
	<br>
	<br>	Ready and awaiting orders.
	<br>
	<br>	I see we have extra help.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, well, serena's spending thanksgiving
	<br>	with us this year.
	<br>
	<br>	Ah, the more the merrier.
	<br>
	<br>	Happy to have you, my dear.
	<br>
	<br>	Whoo!
	<br>
	<br>	Yes!
	<br>
	<br>	The canap?S were a huge success.
	<br>
	<br>	I saved one for you, blair.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not really hungry.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, what does that mean,
	<br>	you're not really hungry?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i had, like, 15 of them this morning
	<br>	when daddy first made them.
	<br>
	<br>	15?
	<br>
	<br>	Serena.
	<br>
	<br>	Serena!
	<br>
	<br>	Do you think that's wise?
	<br>
	<br>	Darling, she's fine.
	<br>
	<br>	She has been for two months.
	<br>
	<br>	What did the doctor say?
	<br>
	<br>	Don't drive us crazy, okay?
	<br>
	<br>	- So, please.
	<br>	- Ah, fine.
	<br>
	<br>	We are going to need to
	<br>	set another place at the table.
	<br>
	<br>	Laurel brought one of the models
	<br>	i'm working with.
	<br>
	<br>	Do i know her?
	<br>	What's her name?
	<br>
	<br>	His name is roman.
	<br>
	<br>	Ah.Roman.
	<br>
	<br>	Not this one, harold.
	<br>
	<br>	We have to work together.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, you!
	<br>
	<br>	- Happy thanksgiving.
	<br>	- You, too.
	<br>
	<br>	- Good to see you.
	<br>	- Want one?
	<br>
	<br>	Ah, sure.
	<br>
	<br>	- Good boy.
	<br>	- Nate the great.
	<br>
	<br>	- So what'd i miss?
	<br>	- Mm, nothing.
	<br>
	<br>	You're about to witness
	<br>	the return of sober serena.
	<br>
	<br>	- Oh, nate!
	<br>	- Oh, no.
	<br>
	<br>	Or maybe not.
	<br>
	<br>	Sweetie, would you take her upstairs?
	<br>
	<br>	Put her in the bath before your mother
	<br>	gets wind of this whole situation?
	<br>
	<br>	What, and leave you all alone?
	<br>
	<br>	Thanksgiving is our thing.
	<br>
	<br>	Nate, will you please take care of her?
	<br>
	<br>	Please?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, i will.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on.
	<br>
	<br>	Daddy, can i help with the pumpkin pie?
	<br>
	<br>	Of course.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	- Crush them.
	<br>	- Thank you very much.
	<br>
	<br>	Crush them.
	<br>
	<br>	Caterers?
	<br>
	<br>	What's going on here?
	<br>
	<br>	Everyone is getting ready
	<br>	for our lovely dinner,
	<br>
	<br>	and you should be, too.
	<br>
	<br>	Everyone except daddy.
	<br>
	<br>	Where is he?
	<br>
	<br>	I thought you knew.
	<br>
	<br>	Knew what?
	<br>
	<br>	Your father isn't coming.
	<br>
	<br>	He didn't tell you?
	<br>
	<br>	He decided to stay in paris.
	<br>
	<br>	He's got either too much work,
	<br>	or roman is too much work.
	<br>
	<br>	Who knows?
	<br>
	<br>	I-i don't understand.
	<br>
	<br>	If he wasn't coming, why wouldn't
	<br>	he just call me and tell me himself?
	<br>
	<br>	Darling, you should know by now
	<br>
	<br>	that your father is not
	<br>	a fan of the difficult conversation.
	<br>
	<br>	Now why don't you run along
	<br>	and change into something a little more...
	<br>
	<br>	Enchanting?
	<br>
	<br>	That's good.
	<br>
	<br>	Are you sure you don't
	<br>	want us to stay with you?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, we don't want to leave you,
	<br>	mom, if you don't feel well.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, no.
	<br>
	<br>	You kids have fun.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't have an appetite anyway.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, hold on a second.
	<br>
	<br>	That must be dan.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey!
	<br>
	<br>	- Room service.
	<br>	- Oh.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, no, no, no, no, sir.
	<br>
	<br>	You have the wrong room.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, no, you're early.
	<br>
	<br>	I lied.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom.
	<br>
	<br>	All i care about
	<br>	is that you two are together.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't want to be an imposition.
	<br>
	<br>	No.
	<br>
	<br>	Man with van, at your service.
	<br>
	<br>	- Hey.
	<br>	- Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, bold choice of attire,
	<br>	mrs.Van der woodsen,
	<br>
	<br>	unless it's what they're wearing
	<br>	on the runway these days.
	<br>
	<br>	No, my mom sicked out
	<br>	because she didn't want to be imposing.
	<br>
	<br>	You know what?
	<br>
	<br>	I am fine just curling up
	<br>	and reading a good book.
	<br>
	<br>	But you're supposed to be
	<br>	with your family on thanksgiving.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, and nicholas sparks
	<br>	is hardly family.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not taking no for an answer.
	<br>
	<br>	In fact, i'm not even asking.
	<br>
	<br>	You are coming with us.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm adult-napping you.
	<br>
	<br>	Fine, just stop talking,
	<br>
	<br>	and i'll get ready.
	<br>
	<br>	Make it snappy.
	<br>	I'm double-parked.
	<br>
	<br>	Thanks.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, rufus humphrey.
	<br>
	<br>	Leave a message,
	<br>	and i'll get back to you.
	<br>
	<br>	Rufus, it's lily.
	<br>
	<br>	Um, your very persistent son
	<br>	insisted that i join you for dinner.
	<br>
	<br>	I want to remind you that
	<br>	my kids do not know that we are friendly,
	<br>
	<br>	and i would like to keep it that way.
	<br>
	<br>	That said...
	<br>
	<br>	I look forward to seeing you.
	<br>
	<br>	How could he just blow me off?
	<br>
	<br>	???
	<br>
	<br>	??
	<br>
	<br>	???
	<br>
	<br>	??
	<br>
	<br>	???
	<br>
	<br>	??
	<br>
	<br>	???
	<br>
	<br>	??
	<br>
	<br>	???
	<br>
	<br>	??E waldorfs at the last minute.
	<br>
	<br>	Just like i was asked to step down
	<br>	from the committee for the snowflake ball,
	<br>
	<br>	and how i wasn't asked back
	<br>	to the lincoln center foundation.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought at least, your father's lawyer
	<br>	might join us for dessert.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, stop.
	<br>
	<br>	You were all for acting like
	<br>	nothing was wrong until it landed on you.
	<br>
	<br>	Nate.
	<br>
	<br>	I forgot to call the bail bondsman.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe he has nowhere to go.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, no one is more mad than i am,
	<br>
	<br>	but this is not the right way.
	<br>
	<br>	Nathaniel, i don't need you
	<br>	to fight this fight for me.
	<br>
	<br>	Where do you think you're going?
	<br>
	<br>	Anywhere but here.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	What's taking dan and serena so long?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, we're here.
	<br>
	<br>	There you are.
	<br>
	<br>	You're lucky you made it
	<br>	while the turkey's still hot.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, this is serena,
	<br>	and this is her brother eric.
	<br>
	<br>	It is so nice to meet you both.
	<br>
	<br>	- It's nice to meet you, too.
	<br>	- Nice to meet you.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	And this is their mother, lily.
	<br>
	<br>	Happy thanksgiving.
	<br>
	<br>	just in time,
	<br>	THANKSGIVING.LAST YEAR.
	<br>
	<br>	but i thought you were gonna bring pie.
	<br>	THANKSGIVING.LAST YEAR.
	<br>
	<br>	I did, but it kinda
	<br>	got run over by a taxi,
	<br>
	<br>	uh, as i was trying to
	<br>	help this girl stay out of traffic.
	<br>
	<br>	Ah, well, who needs dessert
	<br>	when we have a real-life hero in our midst?
	<br>
	<br>	Your brother just saved a girl.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought you needed to be
	<br>	near a girl for that to happen.
	<br>
	<br>	Not just any girl.
	<br>
	<br>	The girl.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, the blonde you stalk at school?
	<br>
	<br>	Just the one.
	<br>
	<br>	A thing for blondes.
	<br>
	<br>	You are your father's son.
	<br>
	<br>	Not just any blonde.
	<br>
	<br>	Apparently, i like the ones who get drunk
	<br>	on thanksgiving and almost die.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, your dad liked 'em
	<br>	dangerous and troubled, too, so...
	<br>
	<br>	You were dangerous?
	<br>
	<br>	Who said i was talking about me?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i didn't realize
	<br>	there was anyone else.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, it is so nice to meet you.
	<br>
	<br>	Alison.
	<br>
	<br>	Right, it's nice to meet you, too.
	<br>
	<br>	- Lily, was it?
	<br>	- Yes.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i'm just gonna take these coats
	<br>	and put them in, um, dan's room.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, you know what?
	<br>	It's okay.
	<br>
	<br>	I've got them.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay, eric and jenny, napkin duty.
	<br>
	<br>	Serena and dan,
	<br>	i want every water glass filled,
	<br>
	<br>	and every candle you can find lit.
	<br>
	<br>	I am sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	- I did not know that you were--
	<br>	- back?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i am.
	<br>
	<br>	And why would you know?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, dan never mentioned it
	<br>	when he invited me.
	<br>
	<br>	I called.
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't hear the phone.
	<br>
	<br>	You know what?
	<br>
	<br>	It's fine.
	<br>
	<br>	It's fine.
	<br>	Let's just have a great time.
	<br>
	<br>	- This holiday's about sharing.
	<br>	- Right.
	<br>
	<br>	And if you don't mind,
	<br>	um, could we not share too much?
	<br>
	<br>	I haven't exactly
	<br>	told my kids about my past.
	<br>
	<br>	Well...
	<br>
	<br>	Our past.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, turkey's almost room temp, guys.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on down.
	<br>
	<br>	You grab the mashed.
	<br>
	<br>	I got that.
	<br>
	<br>	Happy thanksgiving.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair...
	<br>
	<br>	You haven't touched your food.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on, darling.
	<br>	What has gotten into you?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i was going to wait
	<br>	till after dinner,
	<br>
	<br>	but i guess now
	<br>	is as good a time as any.
	<br>
	<br>	Did you call daddy and say that
	<br>	i didn't want to see him this thanksgiving?
	<br>
	<br>	Of course not.
	<br>
	<br>	What a ridiculous accusation.
	<br>
	<br>	So you didn't tell him
	<br>	that i was so angry at him for leaving,
	<br>
	<br>	that i didn't even
	<br>	want to talk to him today?
	<br>
	<br>	You had no right to uninvite him.
	<br>
	<br>	When are you gonna
	<br>	get it through your head?
	<br>
	<br>	- He left us.
	<br>	- He didn't leave us.
	<br>
	<br>	- He left you.
	<br>	- That's enough.
	<br>
	<br>	That's enough.
	<br>
	<br>	If you want to take this up with me,
	<br>
	<br>	we can discuss it later,
	<br>	after our guests have left.
	<br>
	<br>	Right now you either eat
	<br>	or you leave the table.
	<br>
	<br>	I told you, i'm not hungry.
	<br>
	<br>	Or maybe dessert
	<br>	will change your mind.
	<br>
	<br>	Where is daddy's pie?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't see his pumpkin pie.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, there were so many delicious choices
	<br>	coming from the caterer,
	<br>
	<br>	we just sent that one
	<br>	down to the doorman.
	<br>
	<br>	What is thanksgiving after all, hmm?
	<br>
	<br>	Now choose one of
	<br>	those amazing desserts.
	<br>
	<br>	So, uh, mrs.Van der woodsen,
	<br>
	<br>	um, what were thanksgivings like
	<br>	when you were growing up?
	<br>
	<br>	Serena said you were raised
	<br>	in california?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, i grew up
	<br>	on a little ranch in montecito.
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't know there were little ranches.
	<br>
	<br>	There aren't.
	<br>
	<br>	???
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, sure.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, we're right in the middle of di--
	<br>
	<br>	yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	O-of course.
	<br>	I'm on my way.
	<br>
	<br>	What's up?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry, but i have to go.
	<br>
	<br>	Is everything all right?
	<br>
	<br>	No, but, um,
	<br>	it will be, i hope.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't really say more,
	<br>	but it's nothing about us.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	I was having a lot of fun, though.
	<br>
	<br>	All right.
	<br>
	<br>	Bye.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry, mom.
	<br>	I have to go.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, of course.
	<br>
	<br>	You're such a good friend.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, um, i hope you don't mind,
	<br>	but my daughter has to go.
	<br>
	<br>	Do you need to go with her?
	<br>
	<br>	No, no, no, mom.
	<br>	Stay.
	<br>
	<br>	Have fun, please.
	<br>
	<br>	Thanks, guys.
	<br>
	<br>	It was nice to meet you.
	<br>
	<br>	Is she gonna be okay?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, uh, yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't think
	<br>	it has anything to do with her,
	<br>
	<br>	but, um, you were
	<br>	talking about your ranch.
	<br>
	<br>	Did you have any horses?
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, i had a few.
	<br>
	<br>	Um, i had my own, rosewood.
	<br>
	<br>	My dad has a song called "rosewood."
	<br>
	<br>	oh, but no, not that rosewood.
	<br>
	<br>	I completely forgot about that song.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, it's about my mom.
	<br>
	<br>	You know, 'cause she had this perfume
	<br>	that she always wore.
	<br>
	<br>	- And it was rose and...
	<br>	- Sandalwood.
	<br>
	<br>	Sandalwood.
	<br>
	<br>	It was like her own personal scent.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm a fool.
	<br>
	<br>	You're not a fool.
	<br>
	<br>	Um, raise your hand if you're over 30
	<br>	and acting really weird right now.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry, alison.
	<br>
	<br>	I never told rufus
	<br>	about that horse.
	<br>
	<br>	So i'm sure it's just a coincidence.
	<br>
	<br>	Wait a minute here.
	<br>
	<br>	Why are you talking
	<br>	like you know each other?
	<br>
	<br>	Do you two know each other?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, we kinda did know each other,
	<br>	a long, long time ago.
	<br>
	<br>	What?
	<br>
	<br>	Know each other how?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, my god.
	<br>
	<br>	This is unbelievable.
	<br>
	<br>	You know what?
	<br>	I need some air.
	<br>
	<br>	Don't follow me.
	<br>
	<br>	You have a lot of explaining to do.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, wait.
	<br>
	<br>	May we please be excused?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, sure.
	<br>
	<br>	Watch it.
	<br>	Come on.Come on.Come on.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't want a bath.
	<br>	THANKSGIVING.LAST YEAR.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, too bad.
	<br>	THANKSGIVING.LAST YEAR.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair's direct orders.
	<br>	THANKSGIVING.LAST YEAR.
	<br>
	<br>	- Blair's not the boss of me.
	<br>	- Sit.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, are you new here?
	<br>
	<br>	'Cause blair's the boss
	<br>	of all of us.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, seriously, serena,
	<br>	you smell like the floor of a brewery.
	<br>
	<br>	- I do not.
	<br>	- Yes, you do.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, my god.
	<br>	Yes, i do.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	Brewery floor with a hint of
	<br>	secondhand smoke?
	<br>
	<br>	And a pint of old spice.
	<br>
	<br>	- Whoa.
	<br>	- I totally need a bath.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, deal with it.
	<br>
	<br>	Please.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair's a bossy genius.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, yes, she is.
	<br>
	<br>	So what about you?
	<br>
	<br>	What about me?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't smell like an ashtray.
	<br>
	<br>	But you look like an ass tray.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, serena.
	<br>
	<br>	Stop, stop, stop.
	<br>
	<br>	Stop, serena.
	<br>
	<br>	Serena, stop.
	<br>
	<br>	What's wrong with you?
	<br>
	<br>	God.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh. Ow.
	<br>
	<br>	God.
	<br>
	<br>	Aah!Go away!
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, what, what, what, what, what?
	<br>
	<br>	- You started it, dude.
	<br>	- You started it.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh!
	<br>
	<br>	- What?
	<br>	- Stop it!
	<br>
	<br>	What are you guys doing?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh...
	<br>
	<br>	Um...
	<br>
	<br>	Aah!
	<br>
	<br>	My hair!
	<br>
	<br>	I got you both!
	<br>
	<br>	I'm king of the world.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm king of the world!
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, it's me.
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't mean for it to happen.
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't see your dad downstairs.
	<br>
	<br>	My mother just decides
	<br>	everything, you know?
	<br>
	<br>	Everything in the world
	<br>	is just totally up to her.
	<br>
	<br>	I know.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, why don't we get out of here?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not going back to that party.
	<br>
	<br>	No, i mean, outta here, outta here.
	<br>
	<br>	Out of this apartment,
	<br>	to a place a little more sane.
	<br>
	<br>	Any place would qualify.
	<br>
	<br>	So you actually threatened lily van der woodsen
	<br>	with physical violence?
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, you are a badass.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, well, what can i say?
	<br>
	<br>	I was younger then
	<br>	and wearing steel-toed boots.
	<br>
	<br>	No, no.
	<br>
	<br>	No, we never actually came to blows.
	<br>
	<br>	I focused on
	<br>	transforming my anger into art.
	<br>
	<br>	I made some collages.
	<br>
	<br>	I wrote a trilogy of 1-act plays
	<br>	about her,
	<br>
	<br>	named the character milly,
	<br>	to try to be, you know, subtle.
	<br>
	<br>	It's clever.
	<br>
	<br>	So what was so bad about her?
	<br>
	<br>	And i mean aside from the superior
	<br>	fluttering eyelids and punishing sarcasm.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, uh, she was
	<br>	your dad's first great love,
	<br>
	<br>	as she liked to
	<br>	remind me every chance she got.
	<br>
	<br>	It's kind of hard
	<br>	to compete with that.
	<br>
	<br>	You've uh, been in here
	<br>	for a half-hour.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, well,
	<br>	not nearly enough time to fathom
	<br>
	<br>	how you allowed me
	<br>	to walk into this situation.
	<br>
	<br>	Allowed you?
	<br>	Th--
	<br>
	<br>	you were the last person i expected
	<br>	to come through my front door today.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, well, at the very least,
	<br>
	<br>	you knew that serena would come home
	<br>
	<br>	and tell me all about the wonderful thanksgiving
	<br>	she had with dan, his father, oh, and his mother.
	<br>
	<br>	Is this really how you think
	<br>	i deserve to find out?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know what i do
	<br>	or do not owe you.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean, we haven't actually defined
	<br>	what we are to each other.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, maybe this is
	<br>	the perfect opportunity to do it.
	<br>
	<br>	But, lily...
	<br>
	<br>	These past few weeks have...
	<br>
	<br>	Have been what?
	<br>
	<br>	You can't even say it, can you?
	<br>
	<br>	I can, but i shouldn't.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, for better, for worse,
	<br>	you're one of my oldest friends.
	<br>
	<br>	Oldest friends?
	<br>
	<br>	That's certainly not how it felt
	<br>	when you kissed me at eleanor's party.
	<br>
	<br>	What?
	<br>
	<br>	Alison, honey...
	<br>
	<br>	Dan, will you go and...
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, check on jenny and eric.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, where's dad?
	<br>
	<br>	How dare you do that.
	<br>
	<br>	Leave in the middle
	<br>	of thanksgiving dinner?
	<br>
	<br>	I need to talk to dad.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad?
	<br>
	<br>	Dad?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, my god.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, call 9-1-1.
	<br>
	<br>	Hurry!
	<br>
	<br>	Dad, please, wake up.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad!
	<br>
	<br>	Dorita.
	<br>
	<br>	THANKSGIVING.
	<br>
	<br>	Easy.
	<br>	THANKSGIVING.LAST YEAR.
	<br>
	<br>	- Take a seat, honey.
	<br>	- Oh, goodness.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, how do i smell now?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, you smell fantastic,
	<br>
	<br>	but you might not wanna
	<br>	keep asking people that.
	<br>
	<br>	Serena, you look wonderful.
	<br>
	<br>	That shirt was made for you.
	<br>
	<br>	Actually, it was made for you.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i knew
	<br>	there was a reason i liked it.
	<br>
	<br>	Yours, too, i see.
	<br>
	<br>	And mine.
	<br>
	<br>	- No, no, no, no.
	<br>	- Oh, no, no, no.
	<br>
	<br>	Would you help me with the potatoes?
	<br>
	<br>	Yes.
	<br>
	<br>	Don't tell me it's a big deal.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm well aware of the stakes.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey.Who's dad talking to?
	<br>
	<br>	What now?
	<br>
	<br>	The office.
	<br>
	<br>	Something about that deal
	<br>	with the dutch company.
	<br>
	<br>	So it looks like i'll have to
	<br>	slip out for a few minutes.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad, it's a holiday.
	<br>
	<br>	Not in amsterdam.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, we are in america.
	<br>
	<br>	Tell them it will wait
	<br>	till tomorrow.
	<br>
	<br>	Sweetheart, i don't want to go.
	<br>
	<br>	I have to.
	<br>
	<br>	I brought this deal in,
	<br>
	<br>	but if meltzer closes it without me,
	<br>	i don't get the commission.
	<br>
	<br>	Forget the commission.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll write you a check myself.
	<br>
	<br>	Sit.
	<br>	We're just about to eat.
	<br>
	<br>	I think i just lost my appetite.
	<br>
	<br>	Your father and his headaches.
	<br>
	<br>	Give the man some gravy.
	<br>
	<br>	Probably took the vicodin
	<br>	and forgot.
	<br>
	<br>	Had some whiskey,
	<br>	and the next thing you know--
	<br>
	<br>	mom, seriously, did you hear anything
	<br>	the doctor said?
	<br>
	<br>	With what he took,
	<br>	he could have cured 30 headaches.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, he's got a problem,
	<br>	and ignoring it almost killed him.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, no.
	<br>
	<br>	This is not my fault.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not blaming anybody.
	<br>
	<br>	You can blame whoever you want,
	<br>	just not me.
	<br>
	<br>	All i'm guilty of
	<br>	is trying to make his life easier.
	<br>
	<br>	Easier?
	<br>
	<br>	You've made his life impossible.
	<br>
	<br>	What do you mean?
	<br>
	<br>	He's had everything he ever wanted
	<br>	just handed to him.
	<br>
	<br>	My father set him up
	<br>	with his own firm.
	<br>
	<br>	He gave us the house that we live in,
	<br>	the hamptons, the boat.
	<br>
	<br>	He's never had to earn a dime,
	<br>
	<br>	and how do you think
	<br>	that's working out for him, mom, huh?
	<br>
	<br>	Wake up!
	<br>
	<br>	All he had to do
	<br>	was sit behind a desk,
	<br>
	<br>	put on a suit and not get arrested,
	<br>
	<br>	and he couldn't manage to do that.
	<br>
	<br>	You want me to give him
	<br>	more responsibility in the family?
	<br>
	<br>	Look, i don't know what the answer is,
	<br>
	<br>	but we can't keep going on like this,
	<br>	or else we'll lose him.
	<br>
	<br>	Excuse me.
	<br>
	<br>	Sorry to interrupt,
	<br>	but mr.Archibald is awake.
	<br>
	<br>	He was asking for you.
	<br>
	<br>	- Thank you.
	<br>	- You're welcome.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll go see how he's doing.
	<br>
	<br>	No.
	<br>
	<br>	I will.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not saying
	<br>	you're overreacting per se,
	<br>
	<br>	just having a reaction that is above
	<br>	and beyond what is appropriate.
	<br>
	<br>	I have been killing myself trying
	<br>	to make upfor what happened in hudson.
	<br>
	<br>	Which is not an overreaction,
	<br>	i might add.
	<br>
	<br>	And then i find out that the two of you
	<br>	are making out at theme parties?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, it was hardly making out,
	<br>	and there is an explanation.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, guys.
	<br>	I'm back, and i...
	<br>
	<br>	Brought...Blair.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	Wow.
	<br>
	<br>	Weird vibe.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	Where's dan?
	<br>
	<br>	There's no chance
	<br>	we're related, right?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, look at eric's roots.
	<br>
	<br>	What do you mean?
	<br>
	<br>	What's wrong with my roots?
	<br>
	<br>	They're kind of rufus-like.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	Serena and blair.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, it's me.
	<br>
	<br>	Explanation to follow,
	<br>
	<br>	but first,
	<br>	what's going on with our parents?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, uh, our dad dated your mom.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, we're not related, though.
	<br>
	<br>	What?
	<br>
	<br>	Ignore my roots.
	<br>
	<br>	Wait.
	<br>	Wait.What?
	<br>
	<br>	You know what's really weird?
	<br>
	<br>	There's a garage door
	<br>	in the middle of your room.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh.
	<br>
	<br>	Is that cedric?
	<br>
	<br>	Wow.This day just got a lot worse.
	<br>
	<br>	Hold on.
	<br>
	<br>	How serious were they--our parents?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, i think it's safe to say
	<br>	that they have had sex.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh.
	<br>
	<br>	No, no, no.
	<br>
	<br>	No, i'm gonna faint.
	<br>
	<br>	To repeat, we are not related.
	<br>
	<br>	She was a groupie,
	<br>	and he was almost famous.
	<br>
	<br>	Suddenly, my family seems so sane.
	<br>
	<br>	This is too much to handle
	<br>	on an empty stomach.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, we're not
	<br>	going back out there, so...
	<br>
	<br>	Well, can we
	<br>	leave here then, please?
	<br>
	<br>	Escape.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know.
	<br>	Maybe eat?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, that's why
	<br>	they call it a fire escape.
	<br>
	<br>	I think we're
	<br>	splitting hairs here, rufus.
	<br>
	<br>	An emotional affair
	<br>	is just as bad as a--as a physical one.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, please, nobody's buying that.
	<br>
	<br>	Emotional affairs are necessary
	<br>	to keep a marriage alive.
	<br>
	<br>	And how many times
	<br>	have you been divorced?
	<br>
	<br>	Alison, this is not about lily.
	<br>
	<br>	This is about you and me.
	<br>
	<br>	Exactly,
	<br>
	<br>	and if we're gonna have any chance,
	<br>	then she can't be here.
	<br>
	<br>	What, for thanksgiving?
	<br>
	<br>	Or ever?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, you can't be serious.
	<br>
	<br>	I am.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, i have made mistakes,
	<br>	and i know that,
	<br>
	<br>	but if she's in your life,
	<br>	you're never gonna get over her.
	<br>
	<br>	Alison.
	<br>
	<br>	This is it, rufus, okay?
	<br>
	<br>	If you wanna make this work,
	<br>	then you have to make a choice.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, is such a hypocrite, and all these years,
	<br>	she's been riding me about my behavior.
	<br>
	<br>	And here she's just
	<br>	mad at you for being her.
	<br>
	<br>	And all this time, my dad has been giving me
	<br>	this advice based on this girl he dated.
	<br>
	<br>	This girl--"a lot like serena.
	<br>
	<br>	" it's her mom.
	<br>
	<br>	When you think about it, it makes total
	<br>	sense that your mom was a groupie.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean, only a woman that had completely
	<br>	satisfied her sexual appetite in her youth
	<br>
	<br>	would ever marry your stepdads.
	<br>
	<br>	- Blair, can we not talk about mom's appetite?
	<br>	- Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	Or who-- or who satisfied it.
	<br>
	<br>	It's just...
	<br>
	<br>	So...
	<br>
	<br>	Gross.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, mom.
	<br>
	<br>	Is everything okay?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	Do you--do you wanna go home?
	<br>
	<br>	We could call a car.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, no, not yet.
	<br>
	<br>	Um, i need fries.
	<br>
	<br>	Excuse me.
	<br>
	<br>	Could i get some french fries?
	<br>
	<br>	And just keep 'em coming.
	<br>
	<br>	Sure. Coming right up.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, we should-- jenny and i should
	<br>	probably head back to the loft.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm gonna go, too.
	<br>
	<br>	Leave you guys alone.
	<br>
	<br>	S.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you for today.
	<br>
	<br>	The sandwich was delicious.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm calling dr.Sherman tomorrow.
	<br>
	<br>	- Bye.
	<br>	- Bye.
	<br>
	<br>	Is that really necessary, mom?
	<br>
	<br>	From what i hear, you have been
	<br>	in places far dirtier than this.
	<br>
	<br>	Well...
	<br>
	<br>	Please.
	<br>
	<br>	Try spending nine hours with
	<br>	jane's addiction on the ohio turnpike.
	<br>
	<br>	Then we'll talk about dirty.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	See you later, waldorf.
	<br>
	<br>	So, uh, so today was not boring.
	<br>
	<br>	No.
	<br>
	<br>	I never should have asked mom to come home,
	<br>
	<br>	but i didn't see this coming.
	<br>
	<br>	Who could've?
	<br>
	<br>	Don't worry about it.
	<br>
	<br>	It's so weird to think that
	<br>	our parents had lives before us, you know?
	<br>
	<br>	I know, or that they had lives
	<br>	before each other, huh?
	<br>
	<br>	Lily seemed pretty upset.
	<br>
	<br>	I wonder what happened
	<br>	while we were gone.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, i-i don't know, but it looks like
	<br>	we're about to find out.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey!
	<br>
	<br>	Who's in the mood for a little
	<br>	humphrey family scrimmage?
	<br>
	<br>	What'll it be?
	<br>
	<br>	Kids against the parents?
	<br>
	<br>	Boys against the girls?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, definitely girls against the boys
	<br>	because last year,
	<br>
	<br>	i got burned
	<br>	by dan's weak forward pass.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, hey, i was nursing
	<br>	a rotator cuff injury from aught-5.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on, mom.
	<br>
	<br>	Let's go work out our plays.
	<br>
	<br>	Yep.
	<br>
	<br>	So, uh, dad, not that i'm--
	<br>	not that i'm mad, exactly,
	<br>
	<br>	but not telling me about
	<br>	serena's mom was extremely uncool.
	<br>
	<br>	I should've said something, i know.
	<br>
	<br>	And i'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	Given the ick factor alone,
	<br>
	<br>	i would say that you set my progress back
	<br>	by at least several months.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, come on.
	<br>
	<br>	You're a humphrey man.
	<br>
	<br>	No daughter of lily's could ever resist.
	<br>
	<br>	How'd you leave it back there with her?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, i wouldn't be expecting lil
	<br>	over for dinner anytime soon.
	<br>
	<br>	Your mom and i need to
	<br>	focus on the future, not the past.
	<br>
	<br>	That's a lot easier for
	<br>	all of us without her around.
	<br>
	<br>	Well...
	<br>
	<br>	Well, let's play
	<br>	with the old pigskin then.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom.
	<br>
	<br>	Here you are.
	<br>
	<br>	And here you are.
	<br>
	<br>	You had me worried sick.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair, uh...
	<br>
	<br>	I know i-i shouldn't have lied
	<br>	to you about your father.
	<br>
	<br>	That never stopped you before.
	<br>
	<br>	True.
	<br>
	<br>	But...
	<br>
	<br>	The real truth...
	<br>
	<br>	Divorce papers from your father,
	<br>	and i'm supposed to sign them.
	<br>
	<br>	I haven't yet.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom...
	<br>
	<br>	He's living in europe...
	<br>
	<br>	With a man.
	<br>
	<br>	You can't be all that surprised
	<br>	that he wants a divorce.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not, but what i-- what i am surprised
	<br>	about is how it makes me feel.
	<br>
	<br>	He was my husband, after all.
	<br>
	<br>	My harold...
	<br>
	<br>	For almost 20 years.
	<br>
	<br>	I couldn't face him...
	<br>
	<br>	During the holidays.
	<br>
	<br>	It was always our happiest time.
	<br>
	<br>	Why didn't you just tell me that?
	<br>
	<br>	And let you choose
	<br>	between the two of us?
	<br>
	<br>	I wonder who would've won that battle.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, i would have been entirely alone.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, uh, i was anyway.
	<br>
	<br>	It's still thanksgiving.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	What do you want to do?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, you're still here.
	<br>
	<br>	I guess i must have fallen back asleep.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, you were, uh, you were pretty out
	<br>	of it when i first came in.
	<br>
	<br>	Where's your mom?
	<br>
	<br>	She's getting coffee.
	<br>
	<br>	How's your mom?
	<br>
	<br>	She's gonna be all right.
	<br>
	<br>	We all are.
	<br>
	<br>	So...
	<br>
	<br>	Vicodin and whiskey, huh?
	<br>
	<br>	I guess i forgot i took that medicine
	<br>	when i took that drink.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad, we're not doing this anymore.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay? We're just not.
	<br>
	<br>	I know it wasn't an accident.
	<br>
	<br>	Of course it was.
	<br>
	<br>	And when i found you,
	<br>	i thought you were dead.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	I just didn't...
	<br>
	<br>	I couldn't-- yes, you can.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad, you have to, please.
	<br>
	<br>	I know it might not
	<br>	always feel that way, but...
	<br>
	<br>	We need you.
	<br>
	<br>	Dad, we need you.
	<br>
	<br>	Here you go, nate.
	<br>
	<br>	Ah, thank you, mr.Waldorf.
	<br>
	<br>	My dad will appreciate this.
	<br>
	<br>	- It's a pleasure.
	<br>	- Keep out the gravy.
	<br>
	<br>	He's got high cholesterol.
	<br>
	<br>	- Anne, it's thanksgiving.
	<br>	- Mom, seriously.
	<br>
	<br>	- Give the man some gravy.
	<br>	- It's okay.
	<br>
	<br>	- Happy thanksgiving.
	<br>	- Happy thanksgiving.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, you, too, man. All right.
	<br>	See you soon.
	<br>
	<br>	Good night, sweetheart.
	<br>
	<br>	Good night.
	<br>
	<br>	- Hello.Happy thanksgiving.
	<br>	- Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	- Happy thanksgiving, blair.
	<br>	- Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	I am looking for my daughter.
	<br>
	<br>	Where is my little girl?
	<br>
	<br>	Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	???
	<br>
	<br>	bye, blair.
	<br>
	<br>	Happy thanksgiving.
	<br>
	<br>	This time, i went for the ginger tea.
	<br>
	<br>	Good.
	<br>
	<br>	hello.
	<br>
	<br>	Where were you?
	<br>
	<br>	Exquisite.
	<br>
	<br>	Just say it.
	<br>
	<br>	Give me my shoe.
	<br>
	<br>	hey, dan, will you pass the mashed?
	<br>
	<br>	It's over...
	<br>
	<br>	What? Oh, yeah, here.
	<br>	I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on, son.
	<br>
	<br>	You're asleep at the wheel.
	<br>
	<br>	The humphrey family thanksgiving dinner's
	<br>	a well-oiled machine.
	<br>
	<br>	Were you still thinking about
	<br>	your dream girl?
	<br>
	<br>	What?
	<br>
	<br>	No.
	<br>
	<br>	No, no.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm thinking about, um,
	<br>
	<br>	your stuffing, mom,
	<br>
	<br>	- which looks delicious.
	<br>	- Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	- Your stuffing.
	<br>	- Uh-huh.Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, keep dreaming.
	<br>
	<br>	You know, maybe one day
	<br>	she'll actually know your name.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, maybe,
	<br>
	<br>	and then i'll have something
	<br>	to be thankful for.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, shut up.
	<br>
	<br>	Really.
	<br>
	<br>	What's that all about?
