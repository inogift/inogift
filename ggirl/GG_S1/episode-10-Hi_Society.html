<h1>Gossip Girl Season 1 - 10 - HI, SOCIETY      </h1>



<div class="full-script">
	<br>	gossip girl here--
	<br>
	<br>	your one and only source into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
	<br>
	<br>	isn't that carter baizen?
	<br>
	<br>	you're the guy who gave us our first joint, snuck us into our first club.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm in this weekly game-- high stakes, big mey.
	<br>
	<br>	you set me up.
	<br>
	<br>	no one forced his hand.
	<br>
	<br>	your boy lost fair and square.
	<br>
	<br>	i know who blair and those girls are, but i know who i am,
	<br>
	<br>	and i'm not gonna forget that just 'cause i hang out with them.
	<br>
	<br>	you're dismissed, jenny, for good.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm sorry i kissed you.
	<br>
	<br>	your mother must have been kinda surprised to see you.
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, she was.
	<br>
	<br>	hi, rufus.
	<br>
	<br>	if she's in your life, you're never gonna get over her.
	<br>
	<br>	you should deal with your father.
	<br>
	<br>	he needs you.
	<br>	i don't.
	<br>
	<br>	we broke up, okay?
	<br>
	<br>	i like you--only you.
	<br>
	<br>	that's good, because i feel the same about you.
	<br>
	<br>	do you like me?
	<br>
	<br>	define "like.
	<br>
	<br>	" tell me you didn sleep with chuck for revenge.
	<br>
	<br>	well, it wasn't because i like his natural musk.
	<br>
	<br>	Gossip Girl
	<br>	S01E10
	<br>
	<br>	*** hey, upper east siders, it's that time of year again,
	<br>
	<br>	when the mere act of descending a staircase means you're a woman.
	<br>
	<br>	that's right--debutante season.
	<br>
	<br>	and from what we hear, there's been some changes in the lineup.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm actually glad i'm going with prince theodore instead of nate.
	<br>
	<br>	the further we get from the breakup, the more self-involved i see he was.
	<br>
	<br>	always so brooding, so tortured.
	<br>
	<br>	a girl wants romeo, not hamlet.
	<br>
	<br>	romeo died.
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, but he died for something exciting,
	<br>
	<br>	and i want my debutante ball to be something to die for.
	<br>
	<br>	hey, so, uh, has blair mentioned who's escorting her?
	<br>
	<br>	why?
	<br>
	<br>	are you having remorse sex fantasies about your ex?
	<br>
	<br>	what?
	<br>	no.
	<br>
	<br>	don't eff with an effer.
	<br>	i know that look.
	<br>
	<br>	no, man, it's just every time i see her lately, something's different.
	<br>
	<br>	you know, she's lighter.
	<br>	she's happier.
	<br>
	<br>	she's just-- less--less blair.
	<br>
	<br>	she does have a certain glow about her, doesn't she?
	<br>
	<br>	i don't understand why you don't get this, okay?
	<br>
	<br>	a debutante ball is all a girl could ask for.
	<br>
	<br>	it's gorgeous and formal and totally legendary.
	<br>
	<br>	don't forget out of touch and totally classist.
	<br>
	<br>	and if that's how you feel, then why are you even going?
	<br>
	<br>	i'm not going and neither is serena, actually.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm just going to meet her grandmother to make a good impression,
	<br>
	<br>	and, uh, take off before i put my foot in my mouth, like i usually do.
	<br>
	<br>	all i get with nate is some ros?in the back of a town car,
	<br>
	<br>	but with the prince, i get a security detail
	<br>
	<br>	and a high-speed chase to the pierre after it's over.
	<br>
	<br>	i can see you on the cover of "hello!
	<br>	" already.
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, well, try "the new york times.
	<br>
	<br>	" they've chosen me for "a night out with,"
	<br>
	<br>	and i'm gonna give them the most perfect night out of the year.
	<br>
	<br>	with my dad in rehab, it's like the pressure's finally off me.
	<br>
	<br>	you know, i can see blair clearly, and it's...
	<br>
	<br>	i don't know, man.
	<br>	i think i might miss her.
	<br>
	<br>	you don't miss her, man.
	<br>
	<br>	is your mom mad that you're not being presented?
	<br>
	<br>	well, she doesn't really have a leg to stand on
	<br>
	<br>	since i found out she used to be my boyfriend's father's biggest fan.
	<br>
	<br>	- it sounds so gross when you say it out loud.
	<br>
	<br>	- silly me.here i actually thought you wanted to go.
	<br>
	<br>	uh, i'm here with you, aren't i?
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, only 'cause your grandmother's meeting you here.
	<br>
	<br>	you're here!
	<br>	i'm so glad.
	<br>
	<br>	i can't wait for you to meet my grandma cece.
	<br>	you're just gonna love her.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm sure i will.
	<br>
	<br>	well, if you don't listen to me, you're gonna hear it from her,
	<br>
	<br>	and i promise, you don't want that to happen.
	<br>
	<br>	the brands i listed are the key to her happiness, and that includes tanqueray.
	<br>
	<br>	dan, jenny, it's so good to see you.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, hey, jenny, what are you even doing here?
	<br>
	<br>	oh, she loves these things, apparently.
	<br>
	<br>	well, i wish serena did.
	<br>
	<br>	it would make my life a whole lot easier.
	<br>
	<br>	my grandma was the chairwoman for this event for 15 years,
	<br>
	<br>	and now the committee's asked my mom to join.
	<br>
	<br>	and my daughter could not wait to go for ten years,
	<br>
	<br>	and then suddenly, she's not even coming.
	<br>
	<br>	jenny?
	<br>
	<br>	jenny?
	<br>
	<br>	why don't you volunteer?
	<br>
	<br>	uh, well, blair's lead deb, and we're sort of on the outs.
	<br>
	<br>	you know, i'm sure if she wanted my help, she would've asked.
	<br>
	<br>	well, i'm asking.
	<br>
	<br>	i mean, of course, we'd have to get your parents' permission first,
	<br>
	<br>	but, um, we could use more help.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm sure it'll be fine.
	<br>
	<br>	um, see you saturday.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, actually, it's sunday.
	<br>
	<br>	can i call you?
	<br>
	<br>	okay.
	<br>
	<br>	okay.
	<br>
	<br>	- there is my magnificent granddaughter.
	<br>	- grandma.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, hello, mother.
	<br>
	<br>	is there a bar in this place?
	<br>
	<br>	no!
	<br>
	<br>	i should've known i had to bring the party myself.
	<br>
	<br>	so this must be daniel.
	<br>
	<br>	dan, actually.dan humphrey.
	<br>	yeah.hi.
	<br>
	<br>	my granddaughter told me that you were delighted when she decededuh,
	<br>
	<br>	not to make her debut this weekend?
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, go ahead.
	<br>	tell her what you think.
	<br>
	<br>	grandma loves honesty.
	<br>	it's okay.
	<br>
	<br>	well, cotillions just seem antiquated to me.
	<br>
	<br>	you know, remnant of a different age.
	<br>
	<br>	well, do go on.
	<br>
	<br>	people spend all this money to have their daughters basically dance in front of others for attention.
	<br>
	<br>	uh, when, if you ask serena, i bet she'd do that for you right now, free of charge.
	<br>
	<br>	the cotillion teaches the good graces that women should always have in their arsenal.
	<br>
	<br>	i think serena's graces are pretty spectacular as they are.
	<br>
	<br>	- oh, besides, grandma, you haven't used your graces in a while,
	<br>	- rith oh, you.
	<br>
	<br>	- oh, isn't she great?
	<br>	- she's...
	<br>
	<br>	she's great.
	<br>	she's something.
	<br>
	<br>	dan humphrey, was it?
	<br>
	<br>	yes, mother.
	<br>
	<br>	* old gypsy woman spoke to me *
	<br>
	<br>	* said, "you're a wolf, boy, get out of this town" *
	<br>
	<br>	* old gypsy woman spoke to me *
	<br>
	<br>	you looked pretty hot on princess theodore's arm today.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, is that what i am to you?
	<br>	just an accessory?
	<br>
	<br>	next to him, yes.
	<br>
	<br>	- on me, you'd be so much more.
	<br>	- yes, well, i can't be on you, remember?
	<br>
	<br>	because you don't want nate to find out, and i don't want anyone to,
	<br>
	<br>	but you'd have to learn how to behave yourself first.
	<br>
	<br>	miss blair, mr.nate for you.
	<br>
	<br>	what are you doing here, nate?
	<br>
	<br>	well, i, um...
	<br>
	<br>	look, you know, after rehearsal, i just, uh, i couldn't stop thinking about you.
	<br>
	<br>	i mean, the ball's something we've talked about doing together since we were, like, 10 years old,
	<br>
	<br>	- and i've given you every reason to hate me.
	<br>	- true.
	<br>
	<br>	keep going.
	<br>
	<br>	and the prince-- he's, uh, you know, he's a great dancer and all,
	<br>
	<br>	but is there any chance you'd go with me instead, for old times' sake?
	<br>
	<br>	nate, after what you pulled on my birthday,
	<br>
	<br>	the only thing we should be doing together is moving on.
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, i know.
	<br>
	<br>	look, i haven't worn this sweater in, like, forever,
	<br>
	<br>	and i, uh, i just pulled it out today, and i found this.
	<br>
	<br>	it's my pin.
	<br>
	<br>	i sewed it there so you'd always have my heart on your sleeve.
	<br>
	<br>	i know.
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, i figured you might need it back or something, if...
	<br>
	<br>	no, it was a gift.
	<br>
	<br>	the prince will understand.
	<br>
	<br>	maybe we should go to the ball together...
	<br>
	<br>	as friends.
	<br>
	<br>	absolutely.
	<br>
	<br>	but only as friends.
	<br>
	<br>	just friends.
	<br>
	<br>	hey, dad.
	<br>
	<br>	hey, sweetheart.
	<br>
	<br>	i sense a favor about to be asked.
	<br>
	<br>	it's just...
	<br>
	<br>	well, it turns out i got a volunteer position at a charity.
	<br>
	<br>	that's great.
	<br>
	<br>	when is it?
	<br>
	<br>	sunday night, and i know it's mom's opening, and i know it's really important, but i can do both.
	<br>
	<br>	as a family, we support each other.
	<br>
	<br>	and when one of us has something important, we all show up for it.
	<br>
	<br>	maybe you can volunteer next year.
	<br>
	<br>	- dad.
	<br>	- volunteer for what?
	<br>
	<br>	nothing, it doesn't matter 'cause dad said i can't go.
	<br>
	<br>	hey, i, uh, went thrift store shopping, and i found great stuff.
	<br>
	<br>	i got you some black vintage pumps.
	<br>
	<br>	they're gonna go perfectly with the dress you're gonna wear for the opening.
	<br>
	<br>	mom, the kids i go to school with shop at saks and bendel's.
	<br>
	<br>	i can't be walking around in someone's old shoes.
	<br>
	<br>	i know.
	<br>	it's gross.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, that reminds me.
	<br>
	<br>	i still haven't shown you pictures from my summer abroad.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, yes.
	<br>	be right back.
	<br>
	<br>	well, i know you must not be happy, mother.
	<br>
	<br>	i remember how unhappy you were when i didn't go,
	<br>
	<br>	and i imagine you came all this way to change serena's mind,
	<br>
	<br>	but she is intractable on this.
	<br>
	<br>	that's not the reason i came.
	<br>
	<br>	everything okay?
	<br>
	<br>	lily, my darling, the, uh...
	<br>
	<br>	the doctors think they found something.
	<br>
	<br>	something?
	<br>
	<br>	what something?
	<br>
	<br>	something in my lungs.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, no.
	<br>	mom.
	<br>
	<br>	well, they're-- they're running tests, but they said that, uh, it might not be good.
	<br>
	<br>	look, i-i didn't want to worry you.
	<br>
	<br>	i-i don't want to be a burden to you.
	<br>	i...
	<br>
	<br>	oh, no, it's no burden at all.
	<br>
	<br>	all i want to do is to see my granddaughter make her debut the way i did,
	<br>
	<br>	the way my mother did before me.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, mother, anything for you.
	<br>
	<br>	what's going on?
	<br>
	<br>	um, serena, you're going to the debutante ball.
	<br>
	<br>	serena van der woodsen, looks like your invitation just arrived...
	<br>
	<br>	with strings attached.
	<br>
	<br>	come out, come out, wherever you are.
	<br>
	<br>	everything all right, mr.archibald?
	<br>
	<br>	oh, yes, everything's fine.
	<br>
	<br>	it's just my...
	<br>
	<br>	my date-- she's never late, and, uh, she likes to have finaapprpral.
	<br>
	<br>	sorry!
	<br>	sorry, sorry, sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	my cappuccino was decaf, and i couldn't find my phone.
	<br>
	<br>	it took forever to get a cab.
	<br>
	<br>	but you live up the street.
	<br>
	<br>	i wasn't home.
	<br>
	<br>	R U With Him Rt Now?(phone note)
	<br>	well, everything's taken care of.
	<br>
	<br>	i'll pick you up at 5:00 in the car.
	<br>
	<br>	i got that laurent-perrier you like.
	<br>
	<br>	i also thought we'd stop by the modern afterwards for dessert
	<br>
	<br>	, 'cause that's your favorite.
	<br>
	<br>	blair.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, um, we don't have to go anywhere afterwards.
	<br>	it's fine.
	<br>
	<br>	sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	who's texting you so much?
	<br>
	<br>	serena.
	<br>
	<br>	uh, i gotta go back to my house.
	<br>
	<br>	my mom was supposed to throw this tea for serena's grandmother,
	<br>
	<br>	and she had to jet to paris at the last minute, so it's all on me.
	<br>
	<br>	okay, hey, uh, w--i'll stop by and help you out.
	<br>
	<br>	it's all right.i got it.
	<br>	thanks.
	<br>
	<br>	who are you, and what did you do with blair waldorf?
	<br>
	<br>	not bad, archibald.
	<br>
	<br>	i almost forgot how handsome you are.
	<br>
	<br>	spotted-- nate archibald learning you don't know a good thing
	<br>
	<br>	till it's gone and found someone else.
	<br>
	<br>	so your mom really didn't mind your coming to, um, our ball with...me?
	<br>
	<br>	no, not at all.
	<br>
	<br>	and your father is okay with you volunteering as well?
	<br>
	<br>	um, excuse me.
	<br>
	<br>	jenny.
	<br>
	<br>	alison.
	<br>
	<br>	didn't expect to see you...
	<br>	here.
	<br>
	<br>	that's me, unexpected.
	<br>
	<br>	um, mom, can i talk to you for a minute?
	<br>
	<br>	uh, no, sweetie, we'll have plenty of time to talk later.
	<br>
	<br>	you know what?
	<br>
	<br>	it is so nice of you to let jenny come to our little event.
	<br>
	<br>	you know, cotillions really are instructive.
	<br>
	<br>	they teach young girls good social graces...
	<br>
	<br>	well, then i'm sure she'll learn a lot.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm gonna go.
	<br>
	<br>	- um, i'll come with you.
	<br>	- no need.x
	<br>
	<br>	i'll see you later.
	<br>
	<br>	- thank you so much for being so understanding.
	<br>	- oh, come on.
	<br>
	<br>	i would do anything for an ill grandparent,
	<br>
	<br>	and besides, my mom has her art opening, so we're both doing things for our families.
	<br>
	<br>	well, my thing isn't without conditions, believe me.
	<br>
	<br>	i had a long talk with my mom, and i said if i'm gonna do this,
	<br>
	<br>	then i'm gonna be myself in every possible way.
	<br>
	<br>	well, then can you promise me that when you're up there being yourself
	<br>
	<br>	as they auction you off, that you won't go for anything less than a million dollars?
	<br>
	<br>	okay.did you get that out of your system?
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, i think i'm good.
	<br>
	<br>	grandma.
	<br>
	<br>	serena, darling, this is carter baizen, your escort for tomorrow night.
	<br>
	<br>	do you two already know each other?
	<br>
	<br>	actually, we used to go to school together, just a couple years apart.
	<br>
	<br>	- i'm carter.
	<br>	- this is daniel humphrey.
	<br>
	<br>	- dan, actually.
	<br>	- serena's friend.
	<br>
	<br>	no, my--my boyfriend.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, nice to meet you, man.
	<br>
	<br>	nice to meet you.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm sorry.
	<br>	you're not-- you're not escorting her or...
	<br>
	<br>	- no, well, actually, i'm-
	<br>	- unavailable.
	<br>
	<br>	familial obligation.
	<br>
	<br>	there you are.
	<br>
	<br>	are you ready for tea?
	<br>
	<br>	i don't like my ice to get lonely, dear.
	<br>
	<br>	of course, ma'am.
	<br>
	<br>	carter, it is such a pleasure to have you back with us.
	<br>
	<br>	true gentlemen are a rare breed.
	<br>
	<br>	so it is true that you're back.
	<br>
	<br>	back?
	<br>	um, where--where were you?
	<br>
	<br>	oh, where wasn't he?
	<br>
	<br>	he disowned his parents and took off around the world.
	<br>
	<br>	everyone was talking about it.
	<br>
	<br>	gossip girl even had a dedicated carter baizen map on "spotted.
	<br>
	<br>	a map, huh?
	<br>
	<br>	in all honesty, i did go a little out of bounds.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm just grateful my parents are giving me a second chance.
	<br>
	<br>	carter saw the error of his wayward ways,
	<br>
	<br>	and he rose ke a phoenix from the ashes, serena.
	<br>
	<br>	yes, i see that, grandma.
	<br>
	<br>	i mean, they weren't all errors, but...
	<br>
	<br>	well, your mother did tell me that you got into a bit of a--
	<br>
	<br>	ahem--a scrape in dubai.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, i love dubai.
	<br>
	<br>	did you stay at the burj al arab?
	<br>
	<br>	no, i stayed on palm island.
	<br>
	<br>	i think dubai is overrated.
	<br>
	<br>	you know what isn't, though?
	<br>
	<br>	the, uh, prince's crown bombardier.
	<br>
	<br>	and i also went pheasant hunting with the sheikh while i was there.
	<br>
	<br>	i kept the tags.
	<br>
	<br>	i'll return everything tomorrow.
	<br>
	<br>	look...
	<br>
	<br>	i know that my coming back has been rocky...
	<br>
	<br>	but i can't keep being afraid that if i act more like your mother
	<br>
	<br>	and less like your friend, that i'm gonna lose you.
	<br>
	<br>	if you were still in hudson, i'd be able to go.
	<br>
	<br>	well, i am not there.
	<br>
	<br>	i am here, and i don't really care if that makeyou happy or unhappy.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm still your mother.
	<br>
	<br>	you can come to my show tomorrow, and then you are grounded for a week.
	<br>
	<br>	what?
	<br>
	<br>	come on, mom.
	<br>	that's so unfair!x
	<br>
	<br>	i just don't get it.
	<br>
	<br>	i organized everything the way she likes it.
	<br>
	<br>	i mean, i even made sure my bow tie matched her dress.
	<br>
	<br>	like the book says, she just not that into you.
	<br>
	<br>	man, i have to find out if she's seeing someone.
	<br>
	<br>	it's killing me.
	<br>
	<br>	you guys are still pretty close, aren't you?
	<br>
	<br>	could you find out who she's seeing?
	<br>
	<br>	- me?
	<br>	- yes.
	<br>
	<br>	come on, man.
	<br>	whbetter?
	<br>
	<br>	who better, indeed.
	<br>
	<br>	do you like it here, mr.humphrey?
	<br>
	<br>	well, it's a little bit like a museum, a little cold,
	<br>
	<br>	although the water pressure is unparalleled.
	<br>
	<br>	that's not what i meant, but of course, you would make a joke, that goes to my point.
	<br>
	<br>	excuse me?
	<br>	did i miss something here?
	<br>
	<br>	oh, yes.
	<br>
	<br>	the way you feel?
	<br>
	<br>	it never goes away.
	<br>
	<br>	- it just gets worse.
	<br>	- i'm sorry. don't quite-
	<br>
	<br>	you'll always use your dessert fork for your entr?E.
	<br>
	<br>	you'll always feel underdressed,
	<br>	no matter what you wear,
	<br>
	<br>	and at dinner parties,
	<br>	it will be as if there's a language that sounds like english,
	<br>
	<br>	and you think you speak it, but they don't hear you,
	<br>	and you don't understand them.
	<br>
	<br>	as time passes, you'll feel that people never see you
	<br>
	<br>	when they look at you but wonder really
	<br>	whether you're serena's whim or her...
	<br>
	<br>	charity case, until the day comes when you realize
	<br>
	<br>	that girls like serena don't end up with dan humphrey.
	<br>
	<br>	they end up with the carters of the world, and, um, people like you--
	<br>
	<br>	they turn into cocktail party anecdotes of their foolish youth.
	<br>
	<br>	so why don't you, uh, give it up and spare yourself the pain, hmm?
	<br>
	<br>	i'm sure serena will understand.
	<br>
	<br>	this just in--we hear there's a cold war brewing
	<br>	between lonely boy and a certain blue blood.
	<br>
	<br>	we never thought we'd say this ourselves...
	<br>
	<br>	there you are.
	<br>
	<br>	what's going on?
	<br>
	<br>	i'll tell you what's going on.
	<br>
	<br>	i just became your escort to the ball.
	<br>
	<br>	but our money's on brooklyn for the win.
	<br>
	<br>	thanks so much for your time, miss waldorf.
	<br>
	<br>	i guess i'll see you and the prince later tonight.
	<br>
	<br>	uh, actually, i'm not going with the prince anymore.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm going with nate archibald.
	<br>
	<br>	given our history, it was only right.
	<br>
	<br>	he is the perfect gentleman, the perfect date.
	<br>
	<br>	chuck bass.
	<br>
	<br>	hi.john mayberry.
	<br>	"new york times.
	<br>
	<br>	" i'd just like to say how proud i am of miss waldorf and her commitment to mr.archibald,
	<br>
	<br>	even though he ruined her 17th birthday and slept with--
	<br>
	<br>	thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	that was great, right?
	<br>
	<br>	- take care.
	<br>	- all right.
	<br>
	<br>	have a good one.
	<br>
	<br>	what was that?
	<br>
	<br>	i should ask you the same question.
	<br>
	<br>	"perfect gentleman"?
	<br>
	<br>	"perfect date"?
	<br>
	<br>	that broken record was a hit last year.
	<br>
	<br>	get with the times.
	<br>
	<br>	he bores y.
	<br>
	<br>	you almost made a fool of me
	<br>	in front of "the new york times,"
	<br>
	<br>	which proves my very point--
	<br>	you can't be trusted.
	<br>
	<br>	nate is a gentleman.
	<br>
	<br>	he would never cause a scene.
	<br>
	<br>	never get your blood going either.
	<br>
	<br>	speaking of going, that's what you should do.
	<br>
	<br>	carter baizen is on his way here right now.
	<br>
	<br>	what? what the hell are you doing
	<br>	with carter baizen?
	<br>
	<br>	he left his jacket here yesterday,
	<br>
	<br>	and i'd rather you be gone when he got here.
	<br>
	<br>	there's been enough scenes for today.
	<br>
	<br>	so i s it's true what they say
	<br>	about the apple and the tree.
	<br>
	<br>	hello, celia.
	<br>
	<br>	i'd say it's nice to see you,
	<br>	but i know how you hate dishonesty.
	<br>
	<br>	it appears that your son
	<br>	is taking my granddaughter to the ball tonight.
	<br>
	<br>	he is?
	<br>
	<br>	i'd rather see that not happen.
	<br>
	<br>	there's no point in being presented
	<br>	if it's improperly,
	<br>
	<br>	and your daniel is not a proper companion
	<br>	for a girl like serena.
	<br>
	<br>	he's a, um,
	<br>	temporary distraction.
	<br>
	<br>	i need her to focus
	<br>	on her future.
	<br>
	<br>	hers or yours?
	<br>
	<br>	i am willing to purchase all the paintings
	<br>	in this gallery
	<br>
	<br>	in exchange for you convincing your son
	<br>	not to accompany serena.
	<br>
	<br>	before you answer, remember,
	<br>
	<br>	a grown man with children is
	<br>	in a very different position than a young man.
	<br>
	<br>	the money could be useful now.
	<br>
	<br>	not to mention, how much this sale would
	<br>	mean to your wife's career as an artist.
	<br>
	<br>	your money was no good for me then,
	<br>
	<br>	and it's still no good with me now.
	<br>
	<br>	and you can rest assured that like me,
	<br>	my son can't be bought.
	<br>
	<br>	and i can assure you,
	<br>	just like her mother, my granddaughter can be.
	<br>
	<br>	what do you mean?
	<br>
	<br>	all those years ago, i told lily to choose
	<br>	between you and her inheritance.
	<br>
	<br>	i'd tell you the end of that story,
	<br>	but i think you know it by heart.
	<br>
	<br>	you're a little overdressed
	<br>	for an art show, don't you think?
	<br>
	<br>	dad, listen.
	<br>
	<br>	um, i've been meaning to tell you.
	<br>
	<br>	- i'm sorry.
	<br>	- don't worry about your mom.
	<br>
	<br>	i'll take care of it.
	<br>
	<br>	you don't mind?
	<br>
	<br>	i thought i'd be grounded
	<br>	when you found out, just like jenny was.
	<br>
	<br>	i gotta admit, it would be worth it.
	<br>
	<br>	i don't mind at all.
	<br>
	<br>	yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	tux looks great.
	<br>
	<br>	shoes look great.
	<br>
	<br>	you look so great.
	<br>	you're gonna make me proud.
	<br>
	<br>	show that celia rhodes
	<br>	what us humphrey men are made of.
	<br>
	<br>	what's going on here, dad?
	<br>
	<br>	you're--you're doing that thing again
	<br>	where you're acting really weird for no reason.
	<br>
	<br>	it's kind of freaking me out.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, uh,
	<br>
	<br>	serena's grandmother just came to see me.
	<br>
	<br>	um, we need to talk.
	<br>
	<br>	have you seen
	<br>	serena's presentation statement?
	<br>
	<br>	wants to take a year off of school,
	<br>	teach english in south asia?
	<br>
	<br>	this simply won't suffice.
	<br>
	<br>	well, what do you want me to do about it?
	<br>
	<br>	well, if serena's doing this for me,
	<br>	it has to be right.
	<br>
	<br>	besides, it took me years to
	<br>	restore our family name after your exploits.
	<br>
	<br>	trust me, you don't want to do the same.
	<br>
	<br>	hello?
	<br>
	<br>	hey, volunteer.
	<br>
	<br>	where are you?
	<br>
	<br>	you were supposed to be here
	<br>	a half an hour ago.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, um, didn't your mom tell you
	<br>	i'm not coming anymore?
	<br>
	<br>	what?
	<br>
	<br>	i don't understand.
	<br>
	<br>	i thought that this was, like, your dream.
	<br>
	<br>	besides, don't you want to
	<br>	see your brother in a tux?
	<br>
	<br>	wait.
	<br>	what?
	<br>
	<br>	you know, your brother dan--
	<br>
	<br>	the guy who thinks dancing
	<br>	is making fists and pumping 'em into the air?
	<br>
	<br>	dan's going to the ball?
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, it--it was just a last minute thing.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm sure he just forgot to tell you.
	<br>
	<br>	um, i'm on my way.
	<br>
	<br>	hey!
	<br>
	<br>	w-wow.you look incredible.
	<br>
	<br>	thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	you're early.
	<br>
	<br>	well, uh, yeah, we need to talk.
	<br>
	<br>	what's up?
	<br>
	<br>	is your grandmother here?
	<br>	where is she?
	<br>
	<br>	oh, yeah, she's in the other room,
	<br>	getting ready with my mom.
	<br>
	<br>	why?
	<br>
	<br>	i gotta be honest about something here.
	<br>
	<br>	um, i don't think your grandmother
	<br>	is who you think she is.
	<br>
	<br>	what are you talking about?
	<br>
	<br>	i know she's got
	<br>	the whole free spirit act perfected...
	<br>
	<br>	act?
	<br>
	<br>	but i don't think she has
	<br>	your best interests at heart.
	<br>
	<br>	where are you going with this, dan?
	<br>
	<br>	she came by my dad's gallery today.
	<br>
	<br>	well, she probably just
	<br>	wanted to see your mom's art.
	<br>
	<br>	no, she was trying to buy him off
	<br>	so i wouldn't go with you tonight.
	<br>
	<br>	no, she wouldn't do something like that.
	<br>
	<br>	serena, that's what i'm trying to tell you.
	<br>
	<br>	that woman is the most manipulative person
	<br>	i've ever met.
	<br>
	<br>	she makes your--
	<br>	your mother look like gandhi.
	<br>
	<br>	that's my grandmother you're talking about.
	<br>
	<br>	- i love her.
	<br>	- i know.
	<br>
	<br>	i know, and i'm so sorry,
	<br>
	<br>	but maybe you love her so much
	<br>	that you can't see what she's doing.
	<br>
	<br>	i said it.
	<br>
	<br>	there.
	<br>
	<br>	mae we s suldn't be doing this.
	<br>
	<br>	maybe we shouldn't.
	<br>
	<br>	i'll just talk to you later.
	<br>
	<br>	let's get carter on the phone.
	<br>
	<br>	yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	carter baizen's dating blair?
	<br>
	<br>	he's got everyone fooled.
	<br>
	<br>	blair thinks he's reformed.
	<br>
	<br>	he's obviously just toying with her
	<br>	to get at you.
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, well, it's working.
	<br>
	<br>	we just need to wait
	<br>	until we can get him in a public place,
	<br>
	<br>	where everyone who thinks he's changed
	<br>	can see the truth,
	<br>
	<br>	and we can get him back
	<br>	for everything he's done to you
	<br>
	<br>	and everything he's doing to blair.
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, when's that gonna happen, huh?
	<br>
	<br>	sir.
	<br>
	<br>	i have a feeling
	<br>	it may be sooner than you think.
	<br>
	<br>	if you don't pull it together,
	<br>	i'm gonna go naomi campbell on you.
	<br>
	<br>	maybe jenny can help you.
	<br>
	<br>	no, i'm fine. thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	serena,
	<br>	uh, miss erlich needs to know
	<br>
	<br>	how to pronounce that word
	<br>	in your presentation statement.
	<br>
	<br>	i assume it's a family name.
	<br>
	<br>	hey. beautiful.
	<br>
	<br>	what's wrong?
	<br>
	<br>	i didn't write this.
	<br>	my mother did.
	<br>
	<br>	"serena hopes to continue to
	<br>	live on the upper east side,
	<br>
	<br>	devote her life to volunteering
	<br>	for the nature conservancy,
	<br>
	<br>	and junior league
	<br>	and have two wonderful children."
	<br>
	<br>	let me see that.
	<br>
	<br>	make it stop.
	<br>	you sound like me.
	<br>
	<br>	serena, where'dadan?
	<br>
	<br>	he's not coming.
	<br>
	<br>	here you go.
	<br>
	<br>	thanks.
	<br>
	<br>	what is he doing here?
	<br>
	<br>	carter's clever.
	<br>
	<br>	he's using serena as a cover.
	<br>
	<br>	it's not the time yet.
	<br>
	<br>	nate,
	<br>
	<br>	look, i was hoping to see you.
	<br>
	<br>	i wanted to apologize,
	<br>	put the past in the past.
	<br>
	<br>	you don't get to say what goes on here.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm on to you.
	<br>
	<br>	what are you talking about?
	<br>
	<br>	hello and welcome to the annual

	<br>
	<br>	granddaughter of chairwoman emeritus,

	<br>	miss van der woodsen hopes to bed

	<br>
	<br>	uh, cece won.
	<br>
	<br>	she has a habit of doing that,
	<br>
	<br>	but maybe it's for the best.
	<br>
	<br>	you're here with your family.
	<br>
	<br>	hey.
	<br>
	<br>	where's jenny?
	<br>
	<br>	have you seen her?
	<br>
	<br>	actually, uh, no.
	<br>
	<br>	she's probably still upset with me
	<br>	for grounding her
	<br>
	<br>	and is trying to teach me a lesson.
	<br>
	<br>	i don't know. maybe let her
	<br>	be ten minutes late before you get mad?
	<br>
	<br>	mom, this looks great.
	<br>
	<br>	- all of this is beautiful.
	<br>	- thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	- come on.tour.
	<br>	- okay.
	<br>
	<br>	let's go.
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>	nothing.
	<br>
	<br>	We are friends now,right?
	<br>
	<br>	you can tell me.
	<br>
	<br>	and now for someone
	<br>	with only one left foot.
	<br>
	<br>	he just told her
	<br>	what he's going to do to her later.
	<br>
	<br>	they might not know who you are,
	<br>	but i sure as hell never forgot.
	<br>
	<br>	nate, what are you doing?
	<br>
	<br>	she's my girlfriend!
	<br>
	<br>	oh, my god.
	<br>
	<br>	get off me!
	<br>
	<br>	ugh! they ripped my dress.
	<br>
	<br>	take him outside.
	<br>
	<br>	let's get out of here.
	<br>	come on.
	<br>
	<br>	you don't understand.
	<br>
	<br>	- it was custom-made.
	<br>	- blair, it's okay.
	<br>
	<br>	- my mom is gonna be angry.
	<br>	- jenny!
	<br>
	<br>	jenny, hey, hey, we need you.
	<br>
	<br>	please?
	<br>
	<br>	i have to go.
	<br>
	<br>	i have my mom's thing.
	<br>
	<br>	jenny, fix my dress, and all is forgiven.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, you make a fool of the presenter,
	<br>	then you start a brawl.
	<br>
	<br>	i mean, what's next, serena?
	<br>
	<br>	"girls gone wild"?
	<br>
	<br>	serena van der woodsen wants to
	<br>	work for the junior league and have two children?
	<br>
	<br>	it's a society ball, serena.
	<br>
	<br>	you have to represent yourself well.
	<br>
	<br>	how is it representing myself well
	<br>	if it's all lies?
	<br>
	<br>	what happened to you
	<br>	between our talk and now?
	<br>
	<br>	i did this because i knew how important
	<br>	it was for you and grandma,
	<br>
	<br>	and you said that
	<br>	if i did it, i could be myself.
	<br>
	<br>	you don't really want that, do you?
	<br>
	<br>	no, it's not entirely true.
	<br>
	<br>	all you care about when people look at me
	<br>	is what they think of you.
	<br>
	<br>	how am i supposed to accept myself
	<br>	if my own mother doesn't accept me?
	<br>
	<br>	oh, honey, of course i accept you.
	<br>
	<br>	no.
	<br>
	<br>	no, you don't,
	<br>
	<br>	but let me tell you something.
	<br>
	<br>	if i ever do have those two children,
	<br>	i would never do this to them.
	<br>
	<br>	i would accept them for who they are,
	<br>	including who they date, no matter what,
	<br>
	<br>	and i'd make sure they damn well knew it.
	<br>
	<br>	Hello.
	<br>
	<br>	really?
	<br>
	<br>	okay.
	<br>
	<br>	ooh.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm so sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	i know this is not what you signed up for.
	<br>
	<br>	it's okay.
	<br>
	<br>	it doesn't hurt nearly as bad as
	<br>	waking up that morning in santorini and...
	<br>
	<br>	finding you'd jumped on a boat.
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, well, um,
	<br>
	<br>	that night wasn't exactly
	<br>	what i signed up for either.
	<br>
	<br>	the whole thing caught me
	<br>	a bit by surprise.
	<br>
	<br>	no, i, um, i get it,
	<br>
	<br>	which is why i was surprised
	<br>	when your grandmother called me last week.
	<br>
	<br>	wait.
	<br>	last week?
	<br>
	<br>	i wasn't even going to cotillion
	<br>	last week.
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, but cece said she thought
	<br>	you'd change your mind.
	<br>
	<br>	what are you doing here?
	<br>
	<br>	shouldn't you be...
	<br>
	<br>	anywhere but here, yes.
	<br>
	<br>	so please listen to me and don't interrupt,
	<br>
	<br>	because what i have to say
	<br>	is hard for me.
	<br>
	<br>	okay.
	<br>
	<br>	when i was your age,
	<br>
	<br>	i would have been lucky to find a guy
	<br>	like you,
	<br>
	<br>	and i kind of did,
	<br>
	<br>	but when it came down to it,
	<br>
	<br>	i thought my mother knew who i was
	<br>	much better than i knew myself.
	<br>
	<br>	i'm not sure exactly who my daughter was,
	<br>
	<br>	but i know who she's become
	<br>	since she met you.
	<br>
	<br>	she returns home every night
	<br>	at a reasonable hour.
	<br>
	<br>	she doesn't drink.
	<br>	she doesn't do drugs.
	<br>
	<br>	i don't know if you're responsible for that,
	<br>
	<br>	but i don't think it's a coincidence.
	<br>
	<br>	you belong with my daughter,
	<br>
	<br>	and i think everyone should know that.
	<br>
	<br>	will you come with me?
	<br>
	<br>	yes, mrs.van der woodsen.
	<br>	i would love to.
	<br>
	<br>	good.
	<br>
	<br>	and it's lily.
	<br>
	<br>	have you seen nate?
	<br>
	<br>	nate was asked to leave, but here i am.
	<br>
	<br>	i know that look.
	<br>
	<br>	that's your look
	<br>	when your plan falls into place.
	<br>
	<br>	you're enjoying this.
	<br>
	<br>	you knew carter was going to my house.
	<br>
	<br>	you tipped off gossip girl.
	<br>
	<br>	you ruined my cotillion on purpose.
	<br>
	<br>	you did all this for your own enjoyment
	<br>	and didn't care what it would do to me,
	<br>
	<br>	which is exactly
	<br>	why you and i could never work.
	<br>
	<br>	wait.slow down there, waldorf.
	<br>
	<br>	you make me sick.
	<br>
	<br>	this thing between us--
	<br>	it's over for good.
	<br>
	<br>	look, blair, wait.
	<br>
	<br>	- i didn't mean to--
	<br>	- don't talk to me.
	<br>
	<br>	blair!
	<br>
	<br>	that was quite a mess you made,
	<br>
	<br>	but i was able to clean it up.
	<br>
	<br>	the chairs agreed to reissue your presentation
	<br>	statement in the committee's winter newsletter.
	<br>
	<br>	i stood up for you.
	<br>
	<br>	what are you talking about?
	<br>
	<br>	with dan--i defended you.
	<br>
	<br>	mm, we'll talk about that later.
	<br>
	<br>	no, we don't need to talk at all, grana.
	<br>
	<br>	i just want to know one thing.
	<br>
	<br>	are you even ill?
	<br>
	<br>	no.
	<br>
	<br>	but i could be.
	<br>
	<br>	all those cigarettes and cocktails.
	<br>
	<br>	why did you do this?
	<br>
	<br>	oh, serena.
	<br>
	<br>	there is so much you don't understand.
	<br>
	<br>	a woman has to earn the right
	<br>	to create her own rules.
	<br>
	<br>	things aren't the way they were
	<br>	when you were young, grandma.
	<br>
	<br>	you may be right about that.
	<br>
	<br>	hey. have you seen blair waldorf?
	<br>
	<br>	up there.
	<br>
	<br>	it was so hot
	<br>	how you punched carter out.
	<br>
	<br>	i'd never seen you do anything
	<br>	like that before.
	<br>
	<br>	spotted-- chuck bass losing something
	<br>	no one knew he had to begin with--
	<br>
	<br>	his heart.
	<br>
	<br>	mom, i'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	i thought i could make it in time.
	<br>
	<br>	yeah, i know.
	<br>
	<br>	i accept your apology,
	<br>
	<br>	but it doesn't really make it okay.
	<br>
	<br>	sweetie.
	<br>
	<br>	honey, as you get older,
	<br>
	<br>	every choice that you make
	<br>	defines who you're gonna turn into,
	<br>
	<br>	so rather than apologizi to me,
	<br>
	<br>	you need to look at yourself
	<br>	and ask if you like the person you're becoming.
	<br>
	<br>	we're not supposed to talk, remember?
	<br>
	<br>	oh, i had to.i--
	<br>
	<br>	your mother came to see me,
	<br>
	<br>	and she mentioned something about
	<br>	why you left me all those years ago.
	<br>
	<br>	oh.
	<br>
	<br>	yes, well, she made me an offer
	<br>	i couldn't refuse,
	<br>
	<br>	and i wasn't strong enough then.
	<br>
	<br>	why didn't you tell me?
	<br>
	<br>	oh, come on.
	<br>	you never would have understood.
	<br>
	<br>	but if i had known
	<br>	you hadn't actually left me for
	<br>
	<br>	--for him, i-i...
	<br>
	<br>	- i mean, maybe--
	<br>	- listen, don't. don't.
	<br>
	<br>	don't say it.
	<br>
	<br>	don't even think it.
	<br>
	<br>	i can't help myself.
	<br>
	<br>	i never should have let you...
	<br>
	<br>	let me go.
	<br>
	<br>	it's often said
	<br>	that no matter the truth,
	<br>
	<br>	people see what they want to see.
	<br>
	<br>	some people might take a step back
	<br>	and find out
	<br>
	<br>	they were looking
	<br>	at the same big picture all along.
	<br>
	<br>	some people might see that their lies
	<br>	have almost caught up to them.
	<br>
	<br>	some people may see
	<br>	what was there all along.
	<br>
	<br>	and then there are
	<br>	those other people--
	<br>
	<br>	the ones who run as far as they can
	<br>	so they don't have to look at themselves.
	<br>
	<br>	where to, mr.bass?
	<br>
	<br>	the airport.
	<br>
	<br>	and as for me?
	<br>
	<br>	i can see clearly now.
	<br>
	<br>	x.o.x.o., gossip girl.
