<h1>Gossip Girl Season 1 -  4. Bad News Blair  </h1>




<div class="full-script">
	<br>	good morning, upper east siders.
	<br>
	<br>	Gossip
	<br>	girl here--
	<br>
	<br>	your one and only source into the
	<br>	scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, my god.
	<br>
	<br>	You'll never believe
	<br>	what's on "gossip girl.
	<br>
	<br>	" Someone saw serena getting
	<br>	offthe train at grand central.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought everythingwas good between us.
	<br>
	<br>	It was...before I found out
	<br>	you had sex with my boyfriend.
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't come back for you.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, blair's my best
	<br>	friend,and you're her boyfriend.
	<br>
	<br>	And she loves you.
	<br>
	<br>	You'd really go outwith
	<br>	some guy you don't know?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, you can't be
	<br>	worsethan the guys i do know.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, our kids were bound
	<br>	to meet.It's a small island.
	<br>
	<br>	Are you sure it's not some ploy,
	<br>
	<br>	your using my daughterto get to
	<br>	me now that your wife left you?
	<br>
	<br>	Do you ever feel like our whole
	<br>	lives have beenplanned out for us,
	<br>
	<br>	that we're just gonna
	<br>	end up like our parents?
	<br>
	<br>	Man, that's a dark thought.
	<br>
	<br>	Your mother and I didn'twork this hard so
	<br>	you can just make things upas you go along.
	<br>
	<br>	it's a facilityfor the
	<br>	disturbed or addicted.
	<br>
	<br>	The question is, what do you do now?
	<br>
	<br>	I was thinking...
	<br>
	<br>	total social destruction?
	<br>
	<br>	And here I thought
	<br>	you were getting soft.
	<br>
	<br>	It's becauseof their excellent program
	<br>
	<br>	that a student here with
	<br>	ustoday is clean and sober...
	<br>
	<br>	at least, for now.
	<br>
	<br>	She's in rehab?
	<br>
	<br>	No, it's not her.It's
	<br>	her brother who's there.
	<br>
	<br>	I know I said some thingsabout
	<br>	you and your world, and I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	Why did you leavewithout
	<br>	saying good-bye?
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't know how to beyour
	<br>	friend after what I did.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm so sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	Spotted in central park--
	<br>	two white flags waving.
	<br>
	<br>	So what will it be--
	<br>	truce or consequences?

	<br>	Season1 Episode04
	<br>
	<br>	sorry, but you're not on the list.
	<br>
	<br>	Of course I am.
	<br>
	<br>	This is my dream!
	<br>
	<br>	not anymore.
	<br>
	<br>	oh, serena, it's so
	<br>	wonderful to see you.
	<br>
	<br>	hey, upper east siders.
	<br>
	<br>	There's nothing gossip girl
	<br>	likes more than a surprise,
	<br>
	<br>	and we hear blair waldorf's
	<br>	got a 2-for-1 special--
	<br>
	<br>	her mom eleanor, who
	<br>	just returned from paris,
	<br>
	<br>	and serena van der
	<br>	woodsen, brunch buddies.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey!You're up.
	<br>
	<br>	Did we have plans?
	<br>
	<br>	Darling, it is impolite to interrupt.
	<br>
	<br>	I was just telling serena that bendel's
	<br>	is interested in carrying my line.
	<br>
	<br>	Really?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, that's fantastic!
	<br>
	<br>	Why didn't you say something?
	<br>
	<br>	I came back from paris early
	<br>	to put together my lookbook,
	<br>
	<br>	and if they like what they see,
	<br>
	<br>	it could be the beginning of
	<br>	an entire lifestyle collection.
	<br>
	<br>	Because more people
	<br>	should be like you, mother.
	<br>
	<br>	Before you tuck into that, you find
	<br>	a low-fat yogurt more appealing.
	<br>
	<br>	I lost 2 pounds when you were away.
	<br>
	<br>	And you look marvelous.
	<br>
	<br>	Wow, these are beautiful, mrs.Waldorf.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, they will be if they're
	<br>	not all squished from traveling.
	<br>
	<br>	Darling, please.
	<br>
	<br>	Serena, you have to come back
	<br>	later when everything is unpacked.
	<br>
	<br>	I would love to hear your thoughts.You
	<br>	do have such great personal style.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, thank you, but i don't
	<br>	think we'll be able to.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair and I have plans today.
	<br>
	<br>	We do?
	<br>
	<br>	Serena and blair might
	<br>	have plans for the day,
	<br>
	<br>	but nate and chuck are fully
	<br>	booked for the weekend...
	<br>
	<br>	if they survive it.
	<br>
	<br>	- Found it.
	<br>	- Piaget.
	<br>
	<br>	Can't you just call it a watch?
	<br>
	<br>	If it costs more than 10
	<br>	grand, it earns a proper name.
	<br>
	<br>	How about this?
	<br>
	<br>	Definitely that.
	<br>
	<br>	Babe ruth's called shot-- the
	<br>	most famous homer he ever hit.
	<br>
	<br>	Better safe than sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	here we go.
	<br>
	<br>	you've lived through ivy week and hopefully
	<br>	gained entry to the college of your choice.
	<br>
	<br>	Now let's ruin those chances.
	<br>
	<br>	Let me remind
	<br>	you of the rules--
	<br>
	<br>	as of this moment, there is no
	<br>	outside world that I do not show you.
	<br>
	<br>	You eat what I provide,
	<br>	practice what I preach,
	<br>
	<br>	and till I say so,
	<br>
	<br>	the only girls you talk to
	<br>	are the ones I've paid for.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah!
	<br>
	<br>	Let the lost weekend commence!
	<br>
	<br>	one, two, three, twins!
	<br>
	<br>	who brought the sasquatch?
	<br>
	<br>	Isn't that carter baizen?
	<br>
	<br>	I haven't seen him since he was a
	<br>	senior and we were in the eighth grade.
	<br>
	<br>	He looks intense.
	<br>
	<br>	Are you high?
	<br>
	<br>	He looks like matthew
	<br>	mcconaughey between movies.
	<br>
	<br>	The guy's a loser.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, anyone who trades theirtrust fund
	<br>	for a fanny pack flies in the face of all
	<br>
	<br>	that is holy to chuck bass.
	<br>
	<br>	Nate archibald,is that you?
	<br>
	<br>	Baizen, my man!I heard you went rogue!
	<br>
	<br>	- and lived to tell about it.
	<br>	- Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	Seems like someone's itinerary
	<br>	didn't leave room for interlopers.
	<br>
	<br>	Doesn't chuck know a party isn't
	<br>	a party until someone crashes?
	<br>
	<br>	oh, god.
	<br>
	<br>	I forgot whatit was like to be with you.
	<br>
	<br>	No, they were looking at both of us.
	<br>
	<br>	Don't insult me.
	<br>
	<br>	It's beenlike this all morning, starting
	<br>	with your lovely visitwith my mother.
	<br>
	<br>	She didn't even call me to
	<br>	tell me she was coming home.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, she was busy.
	<br>
	<br>	She was rushing to get homeand
	<br>	everything because she wanted to see you.
	<br>
	<br>	She didn't even wake me up.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, you know how
	<br>	eleanorfeels about beauty rest.
	<br>
	<br>	She likes you more than me.
	<br>
	<br>	She does not.You are her daughter.
	<br>
	<br>	She doesn't like anyonemore
	<br>	than you.She just...
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know, doesn't
	<br>	knowhow to show it sometimes.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay, I'm going inside.Wait
	<br>	for me.I'll be right back.
	<br>
	<br>	Humphrey!Dan!Hey!
	<br>
	<br>	Hey!
	<br>
	<br>	oh, my god, this iswhat
	<br>	I love about this city--
	<br>
	<br>	you're alwaysbumping into people.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing here?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, I'm just on my wayback from my
	<br>	mom's, dropping jenny offup in hudson.
	<br>
	<br>	Picked up a couple of
	<br>	cubansfor me and my dad...
	<br>
	<br>	sandwiches, not cigars.
	<br>
	<br>	hey, uh, remember you said, uh,we could
	<br>	get together sometime and, um, not talk?
	<br>
	<br>	I was just wondering,is
	<br>	it "sometime" yet?
	<br>
	<br>	That was disgusting.The
	<br>	D.O.H.Should shut them down.
	<br>
	<br>	- The bathroom?
	<br>	- No, the people.
	<br>
	<br>	It's callednolita, not noshowers.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing here?
	<br>
	<br>	Do I smell pork?
	<br>
	<br>	And cheese?
	<br>
	<br>	Okay, well, when you're
	<br>	donewith your charity work,
	<br>
	<br>	why don't you come find me?
	<br>
	<br>	I'll be at tory burchlooking at ponchos.
	<br>
	<br>	Isn't that the girlthat
	<br>	told the entire school--
	<br>
	<br>	and, oh, several colleges--that
	<br>	you had a drug problem?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	but, you know,blair can be a little...
	<br>
	<br>	- blair.
	<br>	- Yeah, yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	we're actuallytrying to work things out.
	<br>
	<br>	Today's our first dayhanging
	<br>	out together alone.
	<br>
	<br>	so I shouldprobably get back.
	<br>
	<br>	- Yeah.Yeah, sure.That'S...
	<br>	- yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	But, um, call me sometimeso
	<br>	we can get together
	<br>
	<br>	and do that thingyou
	<br>	didn't ask me to do.
	<br>
	<br>	so I don't understand.The
	<br>	last timeI saw your sister,
	<br>
	<br>	she said your familyhad locked you out
	<br>
	<br>	and you'd fallen off
	<br>	the face of the earth.
	<br>
	<br>	I didn'T.I just fell
	<br>	offthe face of theirs.
	<br>
	<br>	But once you turn awayfrom money
	<br>	you see it doesn't buy you freedom,
	<br>
	<br>	it pays for your prison.
	<br>
	<br>	They say I disappeared,
	<br>	but all I did was break out.
	<br>
	<br>	- Where'd you go?
	<br>	- Where didn't I?
	<br>
	<br>	I aided the cleanup post-katrina,
	<br>	spent a yearrebuilding machu picchu--
	<br>
	<br>	which, let me tell
	<br>	you,it's changed my life.
	<br>
	<br>	I bought an H.D.Cam and started
	<br>	filming it for a documentary--
	<br>
	<br>	you're the guywho gave us our first
	<br>	joint, snuck us into our first club,
	<br>
	<br>	and you're gonna tell me the life of
	<br>	youtube filmmakeris better than this?
	<br>
	<br>	You invented the lost weekend.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, who cares about a partywhen
	<br>	you can travel the world?
	<br>
	<br>	exactly.
	<br>
	<br>	In the real world,the only thing that
	<br>	matters is who you are,not what you own.
	<br>
	<br>	As muchas I love the speech
	<br>	about not needingmaterial things
	<br>
	<br>	from a guy who hasthat
	<br>	much product in his hair,
	<br>
	<br>	this party is about
	<br>	excess,not exposition.
	<br>
	<br>	Stop talking.
	<br>
	<br>	Start partying.
	<br>
	<br>	Now here is somethingthat
	<br>	doesn't need material.
	<br>
	<br>	As a matter of fact,it's
	<br>	about to come off.
	<br>
	<br>	Who's with me?
	<br>
	<br>	I think I'm just
	<br>	gonnahang here for a bit.
	<br>
	<br>	Fine.
	<br>
	<br>	I'd hate to break upa
	<br>	matched set anyway.
	<br>
	<br>	how about we continue
	<br>	thisover some cards?
	<br>
	<br>	None of this crapthese kids are playing.
	<br>
	<br>	Texas hold'em is dead.
	<br>
	<br>	you know, I'll show yousome real action.
	<br>
	<br>	You know what?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm in this weekly gamein
	<br>	this, uh, corner in queens.
	<br>
	<br>	It goes all night.
	<br>
	<br>	It's the real deal--high
	<br>	stakes, big money,
	<br>
	<br>	people with the kind of
	<br>	storiesthat would put mine to shame.
	<br>
	<br>	You should--you
	<br>	should come.
	<br>
	<br>	- Yeah.
	<br>	- Yeah?
	<br>
	<br>	this one missedher cue at the chlo?show
	<br>	because she was throwing up a pear.
	<br>
	<br>	ugh.She was invera's "vogue" spread.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't use vera's models.
	<br>
	<br>	None of these are right.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, that's because you're
	<br>	looking atthe high fashion book
	<br>
	<br>	when you should
	<br>	belooking for a new face--
	<br>
	<br>	you know, someone wholooks
	<br>	good in your clothes.
	<br>
	<br>	Someone in this book, like I told you.
	<br>
	<br>	I hate the american appareleffect.
	<br>
	<br>	But they're closerto what you need.
	<br>
	<br>	They're--they're
	<br>	now,they're hip.
	<br>
	<br>	If this person is supposedto represent
	<br>	waldorf designs, you have to find mesomeone...
	<br>
	<br>	worthy of the clothes.
	<br>
	<br>	Someone like me.
	<br>
	<br>	Someone like...
	<br>
	<br>	my daughter.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, why not her?
	<br>
	<br>	You want your line to
	<br>	representthe waldorf lifestyle.
	<br>
	<br>	Who better to represent you
	<br>	than one of your own family?
	<br>
	<br>	She was my first dress form.
	<br>
	<br>	She'd love to!
	<br>
	<br>	I would?
	<br>
	<br>	Eleanor?
	<br>
	<br>	Yes.
	<br>
	<br>	it's perfect.
	<br>
	<br>	Eleanor waldorf, meet the new
	<br>	faceof waldorf for bendel'S.
	<br>
	<br>	Yay!
	<br>
	<br>	is that a smile we see on B.'S lips?
	<br>
	<br>	The spotlight'son her for once,
	<br>	and S.Actually helped her get it.
	<br>
	<br>	I guess miracles can happen.
	<br>
	<br>	It's gonna be so hot.
	<br>
	<br>	The clothes are gorgeous.
	<br>
	<br>	They're all right.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, shut up.They're amazing.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm justdoing my mom a favor.
	<br>
	<br>	The hair and makeup testis tonight.
	<br>
	<br>	I think this is my best pose.
	<br>
	<br>	that's because youcan't
	<br>	see what you look like.
	<br>
	<br>	You're just a hand model,and that's it.
	<br>
	<br>	The right way is this.
	<br>
	<br>	Girls, no.This is how you do it.
	<br>
	<br>	No, no, no.
	<br>
	<br>	Gotta curve your spine
	<br>	forward, elongate.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, no.You guysare doing it all wrong.
	<br>
	<br>	- Look, you're missing the key.
	<br>	- Show us.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, look, look.You gottaput
	<br>	the hand on the hip and pop.
	<br>
	<br>	That's how you gotta do it.
	<br>
	<br>	- pop.Pop.
	<br>	- No, like this.
	<br>
	<br>	hello?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh-huh, who's this?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh!
	<br>
	<br>	Who'd dare interrupt the van
	<br>	der woodsen as she teaches?
	<br>
	<br>	I said, "who?" Give me my phone!
	<br>
	<br>	- Dan humphrey.
	<br>	- Who is it?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry.The number you'vedialed
	<br>	is no longer in service.
	<br>
	<br>	Stop it!who is it?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm doing you a favor.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, I can hear you.Can
	<br>	ijust please talk to serena?
	<br>
	<br>	Apparently,you can, cabbage patch.
	<br>
	<br>	- Come on.Let me have it.
	<br>	- god.
	<br>
	<br>	Hello?Dan!Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm so, so sorry about that.
	<br>
	<br>	And I'm so, so readyto hang up.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair was just playing.
	<br>
	<br>	You havemy full attention, I promise.
	<br>
	<br>	Good, 'cause I was calling to ask you
	<br>	to not talk with me at a movie tonight.
	<br>
	<br>	TonightWhere?What time?
	<br>
	<br>	The sunshine, 7:00.
	<br>
	<br>	I'd love to.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, I'll see you there.
	<br>
	<br>	See you there.
	<br>
	<br>	It's complicated, isn't it?
	<br>
	<br>	I can't stop staring at it.
	<br>
	<br>	It's difficult work.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean that in the best way.
	<br>
	<br>	It's enigmatic.
	<br>
	<br>	It reminds me ofan
	<br>	early bacon or schnabel.
	<br>
	<br>	The artist is in hudson.
	<br>
	<br>	I've represented herfor some...
	<br>
	<br>	time.
	<br>
	<br>	Rufus.
	<br>
	<br>	Bex simon.
	<br>
	<br>	I've heard a lotabout your gallery.
	<br>
	<br>	I wasn't expecting a piece
	<br>	likethis from a former rock star.
	<br>
	<br>	I prefer"one-hit wonder.
	<br>
	<br>	" what turned you gallerist?
	<br>
	<br>	I've always hadartistic pursuits.
	<br>
	<br>	We have something in common.
	<br>
	<br>	I always pursue artists.
	<br>
	<br>	I've been in brooklyn all
	<br>	daylooking for work for a client.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm a buyer.
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't thinkI'd find a piece like
	<br>	this, and I don't thinkit'll be here long.
	<br>
	<br>	I'd to put it on hold.
	<br>
	<br>	May I?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, of course.
	<br>
	<br>	What time do you close?
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>	thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	what is carterstill doing here?
	<br>
	<br>	I invited him.
	<br>
	<br>	Or he invited himself?
	<br>
	<br>	That is his style.
	<br>
	<br>	Begging us to break freeof our prisons
	<br>
	<br>	while stuffing his face with
	<br>	free foodand draining our booze.
	<br>
	<br>	He's a deadbeatand a hypocrite.
	<br>
	<br>	And a good ballplayer,if
	<br>	I remember right.
	<br>
	<br>	You sure you just don't
	<br>	wannalose to him there, chuck?
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe if your d...bought you a
	<br>	basketball team instead of a hotel,
	<br>
	<br>	you'd have some skill.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, this isthe lost weekend
	<br>	for juniors, not senior citizens.
	<br>
	<br>	Go jump into a volcano.
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>	Let's settle it right now.

	<br>
	<br>	Nobody wanted him here.
	<br>
	<br>	He's an older
	<br>	brotherbringing everyone down.
	<br>
	<br>	Let's just play some ball.
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>	Who chose this girl?
	<br>
	<br>	Eleanor.Why?
	<br>
	<br>	She's so prim and stiff,like
	<br>	a bookcase.It's unnatural.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, but she looks stunning
	<br>	in the clothes, don't you agree?
	<br>
	<br>	Mm-hmm, to my eye,like a goddess.
	<br>
	<br>	To this eye?Bleh.like a statue.
	<br>
	<br>	This is retail.It's not editorial.She
	<br>	needs to let go,have fun, loosen up.
	<br>
	<br>	How's the clientgoing to like the dress
	<br>	if the modeldoesn't even like herself?
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>	How did I know this was coming?

	<br>
	<br>	uh,loosen up a little, you know?
	<br>
	<br>	shake it out.
	<br>
	<br>	Um, maybe you could be
	<br>	goofy,like when we were 10
	<br>
	<br>	and we would dance aroundto "genie
	<br>	in a bottle" in your mom's clothes.
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>	I can't let my mother down.
	<br>
	<br>	hey, you almost here?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey,I'm really, really, sorry,
	<br>
	<br>	but I'm kind of stuckat
	<br>	this photo shoot with blair.
	<br>
	<br>	It's a long story, but I don't
	<br>	think I'm gonna be able to make it.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, a photo shoot, huh?
	<br>
	<br>	It sounds really superficial,I know.
	<br>
	<br>	But it's important to her and,
	<br>	you know,she's important to me.
	<br>
	<br>	But I'll make it up to
	<br>	you, though, I promise.
	<br>
	<br>	No, it's no big deal,
	<br>	really.Don't worry about it.
	<br>
	<br>	You're the best.
	<br>
	<br>	I knew you'd understand.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll call you later.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	how many?
	<br>
	<br>	none.
	<br>
	<br>	You're still here.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, I told you I'd wait.
	<br>
	<br>	Mm, a man who keeps his word.
	<br>
	<br>	I like it.
	<br>
	<br>	You get a chanceto talk to your client?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm back, aren't I?
	<br>
	<br>	- Write me up an invoice.
	<br>	- Really?
	<br>
	<br>	That's great.
	<br>
	<br>	Well,you're awfully excited.
	<br>
	<br>	This isn't your first time,is it?
	<br>
	<br>	Selling a painting.
	<br>
	<br>	few firstsare left for me.
	<br>
	<br>	But the artistwill be very pleased.
	<br>
	<br>	She'S...
	<br>
	<br>	been doingother things for a while.
	<br>
	<br>	It's kind of a big dealfor her.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, for my client, too.
	<br>
	<br>	This is a very special piece.
	<br>
	<br>	You wouldn't want to...
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know--celebrate
	<br>	with a drink?
	<br>
	<br>	actually, the previouslymentioned
	<br>	excited artist is my wife.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought you said the
	<br>	artistlived in hudson.
	<br>
	<br>	Long commute.
	<br>
	<br>	She lives there.
	<br>
	<br>	I don'T.
	<br>
	<br>	If the trains everstop running...
	<br>
	<br>	phase
	<br>	three--pub crawl.
	<br>
	<br>	Five boroughs.
	<br>
	<br>	50 pubs...
	<br>
	<br>	500 chances to get laid.
	<br>
	<br>	And remember,don't dip your
	<br>	shillelagh...in the wrong pot of gold.
	<br>
	<br>	let's go.You can think
	<br>	aboutyour boyfriend inside.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not coming.
	<br>
	<br>	seriously,carter baizen sucks.
	<br>
	<br>	All right, I don't knowwhat spell he's
	<br>	put you under, but he's not your friend.
	<br>
	<br>	He can't be trusted.
	<br>
	<br>	And why is that?
	<br>
	<br>	'Cause he doesn't
	<br>	believewhat you believe in?
	<br>
	<br>	It's exactly what he said-- the
	<br>	money, the drugs,the privileges.
	<br>
	<br>	They're just keeping
	<br>	us numbso we don't know
	<br>
	<br>	it's--it's better out
	<br>	therein the real world.
	<br>
	<br>	The real world?Everyoneout
	<br>	there wants to be us.
	<br>
	<br>	We are what you aspire
	<br>	to, not run away from.
	<br>
	<br>	You really don't get me,do you?
	<br>
	<br>	That dream of yours,you
	<br>	know, what is it, really?
	<br>
	<br>	'Cause I hear you talk about how
	<br>	you don't wantto go to dartmouth
	<br>
	<br>	and how you don't want to
	<br>	followin your father's footsteps,
	<br>
	<br>	but what exactly do you want?
	<br>
	<br>	All I know isit's not this.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, you better discoverwhat "it" is
	<br>
	<br>	before you throw everything
	<br>	awaytrying to find it.
	<br>
	<br>	And where are you going?
	<br>
	<br>	how was the movie?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, missable...
	<br>
	<br>	literally.
	<br>
	<br>	I-I don't knowabout serena, dad.
	<br>
	<br>	I-I can't tellif she's worth it.
	<br>
	<br>	What do you mean?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, uh, she's best friendswith
	<br>	this girl--blair waldorf--
	<br>
	<br>	who is basically everythingI
	<br>	hate about the upper east side
	<br>
	<br>	distilled into one
	<br>	95-pound,doe-eyed, bon mot tossing,
	<br>
	<br>	label-whoringpackage of girlie evil.
	<br>
	<br>	- no one's that bad.
	<br>	- She is.
	<br>
	<br>	I would barely be exaggeratingif I told
	<br>	you medusa wantsher withering glare back.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, if there's anythingI've
	<br>	learned it's that usually
	<br>
	<br>	there'ssomething beneath the
	<br>	surface with people like that
	<br>
	<br>	to make them act the way they do.
	<br>
	<br>	Like what-- the O.J.In her mimosa was
	<br>	fromconcentrate, not fresh-squeezed?
	<br>
	<br>	And--and what does this sayabout
	<br>	serena, that this isher best friend?
	<br>
	<br>	I dateda girl like serena once--
	<br>	actually, a lot like serena.
	<br>
	<br>	And girls like thatare
	<br>	challenging.It's true.
	<br>
	<br>	They're complicated and...
	<br>
	<br>	enigmatic...
	<br>
	<br>	and usually worth it.
	<br>
	<br>	And the only wayyou'll know for
	<br>	sure is to jump in with both feet.
	<br>
	<br>	What happened with you?
	<br>
	<br>	I swam for a while...
	<br>
	<br>	till I drowned.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, that--thanks.That's
	<br>	a great story, dad.
	<br>
	<br>	Now get some sleep, and I
	<br>	will see youin the morning.
	<br>
	<br>	We'll goto the photo shoot together.
	<br>
	<br>	You haven't done thissince I was little.
	<br>
	<br>	You haven't been in bed by
	<br>	10:00since you were little.
	<br>
	<br>	You looked beautiful tonight,you know?
	<br>
	<br>	Really?
	<br>
	<br>	hello?
	<br>
	<br>	How was the movie?
	<br>
	<br>	Did I misssomething amazing?
	<br>
	<br>	Well...
	<br>
	<br>	well, uh,even without the movie.
	<br>
	<br>	Don't be cocky.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm calling youwith a makeup plan.
	<br>
	<br>	- Oh, are you now?
	<br>	- I am.
	<br>
	<br>	How would you like to seewhat
	<br>	really happens at a fashion shoot?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry.This is--this
	<br>	is dan humphrey.
	<br>
	<br>	Are you sure you're
	<br>	nottrying to reach my sister?
	<br>
	<br>	Look, I know it's a girlieoffer,
	<br>	but chew on this-- I'll be there.
	<br>
	<br>	Can I bet on that?
	<br>
	<br>	Because law of averagessays
	<br>	I lose my shirt.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, come on.It's blair's shoot, so
	<br>	I have to be there for moral support.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair?Well,I'm definitely not going now.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, she's reallynot
	<br>	as bad as you think.
	<br>
	<br>	Besides, she's gonna beso busy with the
	<br>	shoot that you won't evenhave to see her,
	<br>
	<br>	and since it's so
	<br>	boringon the sidelines,
	<br>
	<br>	you'll havemy full attention.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay, what if I buy you
	<br>	anythingyou want from craft service?
	<br>
	<br>	I thought craft service was free.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll see you in the morningat
	<br>	8:00.I'm texting you the address.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm hanging upbefore
	<br>	thou dost protest again.
	<br>
	<br>	both feet, humphrey.
	<br>
	<br>	what's the emergency apartfrom my not
	<br>	getting my sleep before the big day,
	<br>
	<br>	laurel, and why couldn't we simply
	<br>	havediscussed it over the phone?
	<br>
	<br>	Because if we didn'tmeet in
	<br>	person, I couldn't show you these.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't think this girl
	<br>	iswhat you're trying to say--
	<br>
	<br>	unapproachable,controlled, perfect.
	<br>
	<br>	She is not unapproachable.She is poised.
	<br>
	<br>	She's regal.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, I knowshe's your daughter,
	<br>	and I don't want to make problems...
	<br>
	<br>	But your girlis rigid like a twig.
	<br>
	<br>	You know,she's afraid to let you in,
	<br>
	<br>	so your works of art
	<br>	and she fail to achieve--
	<br>
	<br>	what's the word?
	<br>
	<br>	Symbiosis.
	<br>
	<br>	What can be doneat this stage?
	<br>
	<br>	Your daughter is beautiful,
	<br>	yes,but this girl--
	<br>
	<br>	this girl has it.
	<br>
	<br>	She is warm like sunshine.She has fun.
	<br>
	<br>	She will make the clients
	<br>	thinkif they buy these clothes,
	<br>
	<br>	then they will have fun, too.
	<br>
	<br>	But this is your line,eleanor.
	<br>
	<br>	It's completely your choice.
	<br>
	<br>	The rules for a model the
	<br>	day of a photo shoot are
	<br>
	<br>	similar to those of
	<br>	a patient presurgery--
	<br>
	<br>	***rior, wear comfortable clothing
	<br>
	<br>	and make sure your affairs are in order.
	<br>
	<br>	You never know what
	<br>	could go wrong in a flash.
	<br>
	<br>	hey, B.You must either be
	<br>	sleeping or already on your way.
	<br>
	<br>	But I can't wait to
	<br>	see you at the shoot.
	<br>
	<br>	We're gonna have so much fun!
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, thank godyou're awake.
	<br>
	<br>	Am I late?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, my god.Oh, my god.Did I oversleep?
	<br>
	<br>	Darling,I have some bad news.
	<br>
	<br>	Terry, that foolof a photographer, thinks
	<br>	we need to go in a different direction.
	<br>
	<br>	With the theme?
	<br>
	<br>	With the model.
	<br>
	<br>	Darling, I hired these
	<br>	peoplefor their expertise,
	<br>
	<br>	and ultimately,they feel that...
	<br>
	<br>	we would be doing the branda disservice.
	<br>
	<br>	I-I cannot apologize enough.
	<br>
	<br>	I know that you were
	<br>	reallylooking forward to this.
	<br>
	<br>	No, I wasn'T.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm--I'm gladI
	<br>	don't have to go.
	<br>
	<br>	I hate shoots.
	<br>
	<br>	They're so boring.
	<br>
	<br>	You should havealessandra
	<br>	ambrosio, not an amateur.
	<br>
	<br>	We'll have dinner after,yes?
	<br>
	<br>	Steak frites and crepesat caf?des
	<br>	artistes, just like old times.
	<br>
	<br>	I will see you later.
	<br>
	<br>	hey, S.
	<br>
	<br>	, All right,I hope
	<br>	you're not already there,
	<br>
	<br>	because as it turns out,
	<br>
	<br>	my modeling career's over faster
	<br>	thanjessica simpson's acting one.
	<br>
	<br>	Now that I think about it,
	<br>
	<br>	maybe we should crashthe shoot anyway
	<br>	and see whothey replace me with,
	<br>
	<br>	make fun of the skinny bitch?
	<br>
	<br>	how could you?
	<br>
	<br>	Actually, I like this here.
	<br>
	<br>	This is no joke,humphrey.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doingwith that?
	<br>
	<br>	The question is, what are
	<br>	youdoing selling it to me?
	<br>
	<br>	You...
	<br>
	<br>	you're bex's client.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, and you didn't know.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm just surprisedyou
	<br>	hired someone with taste.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, well,I am equally as shocked,
	<br>
	<br>	because when she said she
	<br>	foundsomething amazing in brooklyn,
	<br>
	<br>	your gallery never entered my mind.
	<br>
	<br>	You'o have tactually recognizeart
	<br>	to remember the place.
	<br>
	<br>	What I recognize is the fact that your
	<br>	wife would not wantthis hanging in my house.
	<br>
	<br>	Alison'sa professional artist.
	<br>
	<br>	She doesn't do background checkson
	<br>	prospective buyers, and neither do I.
	<br>
	<br>	Besides,it's been almost 20 years.
	<br>
	<br>	And you still don't know women.
	<br>
	<br>	And you still know it all.
	<br>
	<br>	Your wife despises me.
	<br>
	<br>	I wouldn't say that.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, she did.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean, she may have
	<br>	beenwearing a slip dress
	<br>
	<br>	and doc martens at the time,but
	<br>	she definitely meant it.
	<br>
	<br>	She's not like you.
	<br>
	<br>	She doesn'thold on to that stuff.
	<br>
	<br>	Why don't you calland ask her?
	<br>
	<br>	Or are you still giving herher space?
	<br>
	<br>	Because trust me,putting
	<br>	this up in my house,
	<br>
	<br>	even having this conversationwith
	<br>	you, will only drive herfurther away.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, what do youwant me to do then?
	<br>
	<br>	Take it back.
	<br>
	<br>	You can call bexand set up a refund.
	<br>
	<br>	So what'd you think of it?
	<br>
	<br>	I thought...
	<br>
	<br>	it was extraordinary.
	<br>
	<br>	we got*** talk.where r u
	<br>
	<br>	***call you later
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>	How much you up?
	<br>
	<br>	That's insane, amigo.
	<br>
	<br>	I should probably
	<br>	quitwhile I'm ahead, huh?
	<br>
	<br>	What?We just started.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, I've had a good run.
	<br>
	<br>	Plus, it's better to
	<br>	leave while you're up.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not--I'm not
	<br>	gonnalet you do that, bro.
	<br>
	<br>	The table'sabout to get smaller.
	<br>
	<br>	People are gonna
	<br>	startshowing their real stuff.
	<br>
	<br>	Up until nowit's been cards, but...
	<br>
	<br>	from now on,it's an adventure.
	<br>
	<br>	Just a couple more hands.
	<br>
	<br>	All right, gents, ante up.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	Let's hit it.
	<br>
	<br>	you've got to be kidding me.
	<br>
	<br>	Fantastic.One, two,
	<br>	three, come on--oh!
	<br>
	<br>	There she is.Blair!Come on, quick.
	<br>
	<br>	What took you so long?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair.
	<br>
	<br>	blairBlair, wait,where are you going?
	<br>
	<br>	Blair, wait.Why are you so mad?
	<br>
	<br>	Why am I mad?
	<br>
	<br>	You meanwhy aren't i furious?
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believefor one second I thought
	<br>	that it'd be different this time!
	<br>
	<br>	You thoughtwhat would be different?
	<br>
	<br>	You couldn't deal withthe spotlight
	<br>	shining on me for once, could you?
	<br>
	<br>	What are you talking about?
	<br>
	<br>	I was told we weredoing this together.
	<br>
	<br>	What, did you not get my message?
	<br>
	<br>	What about this morning then?
	<br>
	<br>	When you glanced at the call
	<br>	sheet,did you see my name on it?
	<br>
	<br>	When I wasn'tin hair and
	<br>	makeup, didn't that seem strange?
	<br>
	<br>	When the dressing roomonly
	<br>	had your name on the door,
	<br>
	<br>	what, did you think they just forgot?
	<br>
	<br>	I was toldyou were running late, and
	<br>	they asked meto do some test shots first.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair, they told me you wanted me here.
	<br>
	<br>	And you believed them?
	<br>
	<br>	Look, blair,I encouraged you to do this.
	<br>
	<br>	Why would I try to stealsomething
	<br>	from you that I pushed you to do?
	<br>
	<br>	Because you take everythingfrom me!
	<br>
	<br>	- Nate, my mom!
	<br>	- Blair!
	<br>
	<br>	You can't even help it.
	<br>
	<br>	It's who you are.
	<br>
	<br>	I just thought maybe this
	<br>	timeit would be different.
	<br>
	<br>	I should have knownI'd be wrong.
	<br>
	<br>	Great.
	<br>
	<br>	Spotted-- lonely
	<br>	boy's rude awakening.
	<br>
	<br>	Upper east side queens
	<br>	aren't born at the top.
	<br>
	<br>	They climb their way up in heels, no
	<br>	matter who they have to tread on to do it.
	<br>
	<br>	terry, I think it's very good.
	<br>
	<br>	I like the bridgein the
	<br>	background, but we need her back.
	<br>
	<br>	I know.What--
	<br>	here you are
	<br>
	<br>	terry wanted me to tell you
	<br>	how perfect you looked...
	<br>
	<br>	- eleanor, I quit.
	<br>	- With these now.
	<br>
	<br>	Wait a minute.Why?
	<br>
	<br>	I think you know why.
	<br>
	<br>	Because of blair?
	<br>
	<br>	I know that she will
	<br>	support my decision...
	<br>
	<br>	Once I explain it to her.
	<br>
	<br>	You know you love the
	<br>	spotlight.You always have.
	<br>
	<br>	It's part of your charm.
	<br>
	<br>	There is nothing
	<br>	wrong with that--
	<br>
	<br>	who are you?
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing here?
	<br>
	<br>	I have no idea, actually.I...
	<br>
	<br>	hey, I k--I kinda overheard
	<br>	youguys in the stairwell there.
	<br>
	<br>	Dan, look, I really can'tgonow.
	<br>
	<br>	O-okay, well, forgetI
	<br>	said anything then.
	<br>
	<br>	In fact, you know what?I'm mute.I'll
	<br>	just stand hereand blink real quiet.
	<br>
	<br>	- Unless you want me
	<br>	to-- - hand me my jeans?
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, please.
	<br>
	<br>	It's just, uh, I thought you
	<br>	wantedto be on the sidelines here.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought you wanted to be
	<br>	herefor your friend blair.
	<br>
	<br>	You know, we weregonna get craft service,
	<br>	and I'd haveyour "full attention"?
	<br>
	<br>	Say it.
	<br>
	<br>	I-I don't think I have to.
	<br>
	<br>	So my best frienddoesn't believe me,
	<br>
	<br>	and neither doesthe guy I like.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, dan, blair's mom
	<br>	basicallytricked me into coming here
	<br>
	<br>	because she didn't want blair.
	<br>
	<br>	How do you tell your best
	<br>	friendsomething like that?
	<br>
	<br>	I-I didn't--I
	<br>	guess I didn't--
	<br>
	<br>	look, you know what, dan?
	<br>
	<br>	Just go, okay?
	<br>
	<br>	I-I need to clean up, and
	<br>	ijust need to get out of here.
	<br>
	<br>	Serena send you hereto talk to me?
	<br>
	<br>	No, believe it or not,I
	<br>	actually came here myself.
	<br>
	<br>	normally, wouldn'tbe this close
	<br>	to you without a tetanus shot.
	<br>
	<br>	my, uh, my mom kinda left
	<br>	usa couple months ago...
	<br>
	<br>	only my...
	<br>
	<br>	my dad and my sister
	<br>	don't really see that...
	<br>
	<br>	'cause she told us she hadto
	<br>	go away for the summer to,
	<br>
	<br>	um, to follow her
	<br>	dreamof being an artist.
	<br>
	<br>	But it's--it's
	<br>	not summer anymore,
	<br>
	<br>	and she's still up there,
	<br>
	<br>	and that's all she seemsto
	<br>	care about right now.
	<br>
	<br>	Every time I go to see her,
	<br>	I tell myself, this time,
	<br>
	<br>	I'm gonna tell her what I think.
	<br>
	<br>	This time, I'm gonnalook
	<br>	her in the eye and say,
	<br>
	<br>	"either come homeor leave for good.
	<br>
	<br>	" And so there I was,just the other day.
	<br>
	<br>	I was sittingacross the table from her,
	<br>
	<br>	looking herstraight in the
	<br>	eye, and I didn't say anything.
	<br>
	<br>	Why not?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know, but I wish I had,
	<br>
	<br>	'cause evenif it didn't change
	<br>	anything, she'd know how I felt.
	<br>
	<br>	bullet, gentlemen.
	<br>

	<br>	- You told me to.
	<br>
	<br>	It's the luck of the draw,my friend.
	<br>
	<br>	He--he had
	<br>	three aces.

	<br>	Wait, wait, wait.Wait.
	<br>
	<br>	A little while?
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>	before I find a way to put it back.

	<br>
	<br>	I mean, it was worth every
	<br>	centto see the last of that guy.
	<br>
	<br>	No, I want to.
	<br>
	<br>	I mean it.
	<br>
	<br>	Thanks.
	<br>
	<br>	- that can't be right.
	<br>	- What's up?
	<br>
	<br>	It says I'm zeroed out.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe you have the wrong account.
	<br>
	<br>	No, no, no, no.There
	<br>	must be something wrong.
	<br>
	<br>	I accessed this accountlast month,
	<br>	and it said there wasalmost $200,000.
	<br>
	<br>	hey, tom, thanks for
	<br>	gettingback to me so quickly.
	<br>
	<br>	Your message said it was important.
	<br>
	<br>	Um, yeah, I was--I was
	<br>	checking my accounts,
	<br>
	<br>	and I came acrosswhat
	<br>	I assume to be an error,
	<br>
	<br>	in that my trust seemsto
	<br>	have a zero balance.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, uh, I thought you knew.
	<br>
	<br>	That account was drainedweeks ago.
	<br>
	<br>	Drained?
	<br>
	<br>	But by who?
	<br>
	<br>	Your father.
	<br>
	<br>	He said he discussed itwith you.
	<br>
	<br>	We--we have to solve this.I
	<br>	mean, what are we gonna do?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not into gettinga lingerie model.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, blair, honey, there's
	<br>	beena terrible mistake.
	<br>
	<br>	How would you likeyour job back?
	<br>
	<br>	Did you choose serenaover me?
	<br>
	<br>	You could've pickeda stranger.
	<br>
	<br>	You didn't have to choosemy best friend.
	<br>
	<br>	What, did you thinkthat
	<br>	I wouldn't find out?
	<br>
	<br>	I was going to tell youtonight...
	<br>
	<br>	at dinner.
	<br>
	<br>	It--there wasno right
	<br>	decision.There...
	<br>
	<br>	there--there
	<br>	wasn't any time.
	<br>
	<br>	I know you can understandall this.
	<br>
	<br>	It was mishandled-- the whole
	<br>	thing--from top to bottom.
	<br>
	<br>	You actually want meto agree with you.
	<br>
	<br>	Bendel's will legitimizethis company.
	<br>
	<br>	It will take everythingto
	<br>	the next level.
	<br>
	<br>	You know how hardI have worked for that.
	<br>
	<br>	You've always been my
	<br>	biggestsupporter, my biggest fan.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm your daughter.
	<br>
	<br>	And as my daughter, I knew
	<br>	that you wouldforgive me,
	<br>
	<br>	in time, but if my company had
	<br>	lostthis deal because of you?
	<br>
	<br>	I'd never forgive myself.
	<br>
	<br>	I hope you never do.
	<br>
	<br>	You didn't hear it from us,
	<br>	but in every girl's life,
	<br>
	<br>	there comes a moment when she realizes
	<br>
	<br>	that her mother just might
	<br>	be more messed up than she is.
	<br>
	<br>	you're still here?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, well,I thought I couldn't leave
	<br>
	<br>	without bringing yousomething
	<br>	from craft service.
	<br>
	<br>	Um, and, uh, and telling
	<br>	youthat I'm sorry I judged you.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, I'm sorryI gave you reason to.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, how aboutyou ask me out again?
	<br>
	<br>	How aboutyou actually show up?
	<br>
	<br>	Okay.
	<br>
	<br>	No drama,no disruptions.I promise.
	<br>
	<br>	You promise?Oh, no!That
	<br>	meansit's never gonna happen now.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay, quick.I take it back.I unpromise.
	<br>
	<br>	Friday.8:00.
	<br>
	<br>	I think we can agreeto those terms,
	<br>
	<br>	but you can't wearthose shoes.
	<br>
	<br>	Or that hair.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay, see you then.
	<br>
	<br>	All right.
	<br>
	<br>	- so you were right.
	<br>	- I know.
	<br>
	<br>	When I got that call,I should've
	<br>	known you had nothing to dowith it.
	<br>
	<br>	And I should never have pushedyou to
	<br>	do this whole thing in the first place.
	<br>
	<br>	Actually,I'm glad you pushed me it ended
	<br>	up beinga very important day for me.
	<br>
	<br>	I just thoughtit was gonna be more fun.
	<br>
	<br>	I know.Me, too.
	<br>
	<br>	hey, you know what?
	<br>
	<br>	Who says it still can't be?
	<br>
	<br>	come on.Come on.
	<br>
	<br>	this just in-- S.And
	<br>	B.Committing a crime of fashion.
	<br>
	<br>	Who doesn't love a 5-finger discount?
	<br>
	<br>	Especially if one of those
	<br>	fingers is the middle one.
	<br>
	<br>	Where are my clothes?
	<br>
	<br>	Everyone knows you
	<br>	can't choose your family,
	<br>
	<br>	but you can choose your friends,
	<br>
	<br>	and in a world ruled by bloodlines and
	<br>	bank accounts, it pays to have a pal.
	<br>
	<br>	Do it again.One,
	<br>	two--one, two, three.
	<br>
	<br>	as a B.F.F can make you go W.T.F,
	<br>
	<br>	there's no denying we'd all be
	<br>	a little less rich without them.
	<br>
	<br>	And serena and blair--they
	<br>	do besties better than anyone.
	<br>
	<br>	no, that's not a tear in my eye.
	<br>
	<br>	It's just allergies.
	<br>
	<br>	Without you, I'm nothing.
	<br>
	<br>	Gossip girl.
	<br>	THEY'RE FOR MY SISTER...
	<br>	FROM THE BROWN REP.
	<br>
	<br>	UM, APPARENTLY HIS COUSIN
	<br>	DID SOME TIME HERE IN HIS YOUTH.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
	<br>
	<br>	I MEAN, AT LEAST
	<br>	HER ENTIRE FUTURE ISN'T BLOWN.
	<br>	I DON'T THINK
	<br>
	<br>	THAT'S MAKING HER FEEL
	<br>	A WHOLE LOT BETTER RIGHT NOW.
	<br>
	<br>	WHENEVER
	<br>	SOMETHING'S BOTHERING YOU,
	<br>
	<br>	I CAN ALWAYS FIND YOU HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU HERE
	<br>	FOR ANOTHER CATFIGHT?
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT'S THAT?
	<br>
	<br>	A LETTER.
	<br>
	<br>	I WROTE IT TO YOU WHEN YOU
	<br>	WERE AWAY AT BOARDING SCHOOL.
	<br>
	<br>	I NEVER SENT IT.
	<br>
	<br>	"DEAR SERENA,
	<br>
	<br>	"MY WORLD IS FALLING APART,
	<br>
	<br>	"AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

	<br>	"YOU'RE GONE..."
	<br>
	<br>	"MY DAD'S GONE.
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>	(voice breaks)
	<br>	"WHERE ARE YOU?
	<br>
	<br>	WHY DON'T YOU CALL?"
	<br>
	<br>	"WHY DID YOU LEAVE
	<br>	WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE?

	<br>	WHY DIDN'T YOU SEND IT?
	<br>
	<br>	I WOULD'VE--
	<br>
	<br>	YOU WOULD'VE WHAT?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNEW, SERENA,
	<br>
	<br>	AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN CALL.
	<br>
	<br>	(voice breaks) I DIDN'T KNOW
	<br>	WHAT TO SAY TO YOU
	<br>
	<br>	OR EVEN HOW TO BE YOUR FRIEND
	<br>	AFTER WHAT I DID.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M SO SORRY.
	<br>
	<br>	ERIC TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED.
	<br>
	<br>	I GUESS YOUR FAMILY'S BEEN
	<br>	GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME, TOO.
	<br>
	<br>	SPOTTED IN CENTRAL PARK--
	<br>
	<br>	TWO WHITE FLAGS WAVING.
	<br>
	<br>	COULD AN UPPER EAST SIDE
	<br>	PEACE ACCORD BE FAR OFF?
	<br>
	<br>	SO WHAT WILL IT BE--
	<br>	TRUCE OR CONSEQUENCES?
	<br>
	<br>	WE ALL KNOW ONE NATION
	<br>	CAN'T HAVE TWO QUEENS.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
	<br>
	<br>	ONLY TIME WILL TELL.
	<br>
	<br>	X.O.X.O., GOSSIP GIRL.
