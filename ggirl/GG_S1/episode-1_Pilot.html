	<p class="full-script"><strong>Rufus:</strong>	Sounds very fair. Sweatshops could learn a thing or two. </p>

	<p class="full-script"><strong>Jenny:</strong>	Dad, this is not a platform for me to end capitalization. That's why you make us go to private schools. </p>

	<p class="full-script"><strong>Rufus:</strong>	That's for your education. </p>

	<p class="full-script"><strong>Jenny:</strong>	So we should be anonymous losers who eat lunch alone and never get invited to parties? </p>

	<p class="full-script"><strong>Dan:</strong>	Works for me. </p>

	<p class="full-script"><strong>Jenny:</strong>	Mom thinks it's a good idea. </p>

	<p class="full-script"><strong>Rufus:</strong>	And her judgment is always sound, right? Jenny, if you wanna go to that party you should go. You kids could use some fun. </p>
