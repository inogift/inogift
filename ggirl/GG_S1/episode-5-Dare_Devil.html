<div class="full-script">
	<br> GOSSIP GIRL
	<br>	HERE--
	<br>
	<br>	YOUR ONE AND ONLY SOURCE INTO THE SCANDALOUS LIVES
	<br>	OF MANHATTAN'S ELITE.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, MY GOD.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE
	<br>	WHAT'S ON "GOSSIP GIRL."
	<br>
	<br>	SOMEONE SAW SERENA AT GRAND CENTRAL.
	<br>
	<br>	I'VE WAITED MY ENTIRE ADOLESCENT
	<br>	LIFE FOR A DATE WITH THIS GIRL.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU'D REALLY GO OUT
	<br>	WITH SOME GUY YOU DON'T KNOW?
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, YOU CAN'T BE WORSE ????
	<br>
	<br>	YOU'RE GOING OUT
	<br>	WITH SERENA,
	<br>
	<br>	AND I'M GOING
	<br>	TO KISS ON THE LIPS.
	<br>
	<br>	WHO SAID THIS FAMILY
	<br>	WASN'T COOL?
	<br>	MM.
	<br>
	<br>	WHY IS MY DAUGHTER GOING TO ONE
	<br>	OF YOUR CONCERTS WITH YOUR SON?
	<br>
	<br>	IF YOU WANT TO BE PART
	<br>	OF THIS WORLD, JENNY,
	<br>
	<br>	YOU NEED TO DECIDE
	<br>	IF ALL THIS... IS WORTH IT.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK, IF YOU'RE READY TO LEAVE,
	<br>	YOU TELL US, OKAY?
	<br>
	<br>	NO MATTER WHAT MOM SAYS.
	<br>
	<br>	I WOULD REALLY LIKE
	<br>	TO GET OUT OF HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	I DID THIS.
	<br>
	<br>	MY MOM KINDA LEFT US
	<br>	A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.
	<br>
	<br>	MY DAD AND MY SISTER
	<br>	DON'T REALLY SEE THAT.
	<br>
	<br>	I DATED A GIRL
	<br>	LIKE SERENA ONCE.
	<br>
	<br>	YOUR WIFE WOULD NOT WANT THIS ???
	<br>
	<br>	SHE DOESN'T DO BACKGROUND CHECKS
	<br>	ON PROSPECTIVE BUYERS,
	<br>
	<br>	AND NEITHER DO I. BESIDES,
	<br>	IT'S BEEN ALMOST 20 YEARS.
	<br>
	<br>	AND YOU STILL ????
	<br>
	<br>	HEY, HOW ABOUT
	<br>	YOU ASK ME OUT AGAIN?
	<br>
	<br>	HOW ABOUT
	<br>	YOU ACTUALLY SHOW UP?
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY. NO DRAMA,
	<br>	NO DISRUPTIONS, I PROMISE.
	<br>
	<br>	PROMISE? OH, NO! THAT MEANS
	<br>	IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN NOW.
	<br>
	<br>	AAH! OKAY, QUICK.
	<br>	I TAKE IT BACK. I UNPROMISE.
	<br>
	<br>	FRIDAY. 8:00.
	<br>
	<br>	AND WHO AM I?
	<br>
	<br>	THAT'S A SECRET
	<br>	I'LL NEVER TELL.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW YOU LOVE ME.
	<br>
	<br>	X.O.X.O., GOSSIP GIRL.
	<br>
	<br>	WITH BLAIR'S BOYFRIEND NATE
	<br>
	<br>	HELPING TO CLOSE UP THE FAMILY
	<br>	YACHT FOR THE SEASON,
	<br>
	<br>	BLAIR IS FREE TO FOCUS
	<br>
	<br>	ON THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENT
	<br>	OF THE FALL--
	<br>
	<br>	HER ANNUAL SLEEPOVER,
	<br>
	<br>	A TRADITION
	<br>	SINCE THE YEAR 2000,
	<br>
	<br>	EACH ONE MORE DECADENT
	<br>	THAN THE LAST.
	<br>
	<br>	NO EXPENSE OR REPUTATION
	<br>	IS SPARED.
	<br>
	<br>	WITH EVERYTHING FROM TRUNDLE
	<br>	BEDS TO TRUFFLES IN PLACE,
	<br>
	<br>	ALL THAT'S MISSING
	<br>
	<br>	IS SLEEPOVER STAR
	<br>	AND WALDORF B.F.F.
	<br>
	<br>	SERENA VAN DER WOODSEN.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY, DAD.
	<br>	I'M HEADED TO THE BANK.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU WANT ME TO DEPOSIT THE CHECK
	<br>	FROM MOM'S SALE WHILE I'M THERE?
	<br>
	<br>	DID YOU KNOCK OVER
	<br>	A PARKING METER?
	<br>
	<br>	NO, THIS IS
	<br>	THE ENTIRE CONTENTS
	<br>
	<br>	FROM MY TEENAGE MUTANT
	<br>	NINJA TURTLE PIGGY BANK.
	<br>
	<br>	HOW LONG CAN A MAN
	<br>	HAVE A PIGGY BANK
	<br>
	<br>	AND STILL CALL HIMSELF
	<br>	A MAN?
	<br>
	<br>	I TH--I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME
	<br>	TO BREAK DONATELLO OPEN.
	<br>
	<br>	SO TONIGHT'S THE BIG NIGHT,
	<br>	HUH?
	<br>
	<br>	IT IS,
	<br>	AND I HAVE IT ALL PLANNED.
	<br>
	<br>	6 POUNDS OF PLAN, ACTUALLY.
	<br>
	<br>	I KNOW IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I TOOK SOMEONE
	<br>	ON A DATE, BUT, UH,
	<br>
	<br>	MOVIE TICKET PRICES HAVEN'T
	<br>	RISEN THAT MUCH, HAVE THEY?
	<br>
	<br>	DAD, THIS IS
	<br>	SERENA VAN DER WOODSEN.
	<br>
	<br>	I CAN'T JUST TAKE HER
	<br>	TO A MOVIE.
	<br>
	<br>	I WANT THIS TO BE PERFECT.
	<br>
	<br>	UM... CHECK?
	<br>
	<br>	WANT ME TO DEPOSIT IT?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU STILL HAVEN'T
	<br>	TOLD HER YET, HAVE YOU?
	<br>
	<br>	DAD,
	<br>	THAT'S MOM FIRST SALE.
	<br>
	<br>	THAT PAINTING SOLD DAYS AGO.
	<br>	IT'S KIND OF A HUGE DEAL.
	<br>
	<br>	I KNOW, WHICH IS WHY
	<br>	I WAS THINKING
	<br>
	<br>	OF SURPRISING HER MYSELF,
	<br>	HEADING UPSTATE TO HUDSON,
	<br>
	<br>	BRINGING HER THE CHECK
	<br>	IN PERSON. WHAT?
	<br>
	<br>	AREN'T I SUPPOSED
	<br>	TO DELIVER GOOD NEWS IN PERSON?
	<br>
	<br>	I THINK THAT'S BAD NEWS.
	<br>
	<br>	GOOD NEWS MIGHT JUST BE FINE
	<br>	WITH A PHONE CALL.
	<br>
	<br>	SO YOU'RE SAYING
	<br>	I SHOULDN'T GO SEE HER?
	<br>
	<br>	I'M SAYING, I DON'T THINK MOM
	<br>	IS A HUGE FAN OF SURPRISES.
	<br>
	<br>	YOUR REMEMBER HER,
	<br>	UH, 30th BIRTHDAY
	<br>
	<br>	WITH THE CLOWN
	<br>	AND HIS LLAMA?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, THAT DIDN'T...
	<br>
	<br>	DIDN'T GO OVER WELL.
	<br>	IT TANKED.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH. I'LL CALL HER FIRST,
	<br>	JUST TO BE SAFE.
	<br>	NEED SOME CHANGE FOR THAT?
	<br>
	<br>	HEY! JUST THE LITTLE SISTER
	<br>	I WAS LOOKING FOR.
	<br>
	<br>	I NEED ANSWERS,
	<br>	AND I NEED THEM NOW.
	<br>
	<br>	YOUR BROTHER
	<br>	IS BEING VERY MYSTERIOUS ABOUT OUR DATE TONIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, HE'S A VERY MYSTERIOUS
	<br>	GUY, APPARENTLY.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK, HE WON'T EVEN TELL ME
	<br>	WHERE WE'RE GOING.
	<br>
	<br>	CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME A HINT?
	<br>
	<br>	ARE WE GOING
	<br>	TO SOME SECRET CLUB
	<br>
	<br>	TO SEE THE BEST UNSIGNED BAND
	<br>	IN BROOKLYN?
	<br>
	<br>	OR--OR A GUERILLA ART EXHIBIT
	<br>	IN DUMBO?
	<br>
	<br>	OR, HEY, ISN'T THE NEW YORK
	<br>	FILM FESTIVAL STILL GOING ON?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU DON'T LEAVE MUCH ROOM
	<br>	FOR SURPRISE, DO YOU?
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, I DON'T KNOW
	<br>	HOW TO DRESS FOR SURPRISE.
	<br>
	<br>	NOT EVERYTHING GOES WITH IT,
	<br>	YOU KNOW.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, I'D SAY JEANS ???
	<br>
	<br>	THE HUMPHREY MEN
	<br>	DO CASUAL FRIDAY EVERY DAY.
	<br>	OH.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, IT'S MY BROTHER.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, I SAY HI.
	<br>	ERIC, HEY,
	<br>
	<br>	Jenny says hi.
	<br>	WELL, HI BACK.
	<br>	DID SHE SPILL ABOUT TONIGHT?
	<br>
	<br>	NO, NOT A DROP.
	<br>	YOU ALL PACKED?
	<br>	Yeah,????
	<br>
	<br>	HEY, SPEAKING OF WHICH,
	<br>	IS MOM STILL THERE?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, SHE'S TALKING
	<br>	TO THE DOCTOR NOW.
	<br>
	<br>	I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S ACTUALLY LETTING ME
	<br>	COME HOME FOR A WEEKEND.
	<br>
	<br>	I DON'T THINK I EVEN REMEMBER
	<br>	WHAT A WEEKEND IS.
	<br>
	<br>	What time's your date? Maybe
	<br>	we'll cross paths at the Palace.
	<br>	7:00
	<br>
	<br>	Can't wait to see u
	<br>	ME, TOO. BYE.
	<br>
	<br>	'KAY, LOVE YOU, ERIC.
	<br>	BYE.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT WAS THAT I HEARD?
	<br>	ERIC'S COMING HOME?
	<br>
	<br>	PERFECT TIMING.
	<br>	HOW SO?
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, IT GIVES YOUR MOTHER
	<br>	AND BROTHER TIME TO BOND
	<br>
	<br>	ALONE TONIGHT WHILE
	<br>	YOU GET DRUNK ON SCHNAPPS
	<br>
	<br>	AND MOON THE N.Y.U. DORMS
	<br>	FROM THE LIMO.
	<br>
	<br>	BLAIR,????
	<br>
	<br>	S., IT'S ONLY THE MOST
	<br>	IMPORTANT NIGHT OF THE FALL.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, THE SLEEPOVER.
	<br>
	<br>	I PREFER "SOIREE."
	<br>
	<br>	"SLEEPOVER"
	<br>	IS SO SOPHOMORE YEAR.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK, YOU KNOW I CAN'T GO
	<br>	TO THAT. I HAVE THAT PLAN.
	<br>
	<br>	SERENA, WHEN THERE'S
	<br>	A WALDORF SOIREE,
	<br>
	<br>	THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
	<br>	ON THE SOCIAL CALENDAR.
	<br>
	<br>	BLAIR, THE PLAN IS DAN.
	<br>
	<br>	REMEMBER, THE GUY YOU REALIZED
	<br>	IS ACTUALLY A HUMAN BEING
	<br>
	<br>	AND WORTHY OF YOUR TIME
	<br>	AND ATTENTION?
	<br>
	<br>	NO OFFENSE.
	<br>	NONE TAKEN.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY,
	<br>	BUT THIS DATE IS UNBREAKABLE.
	<br>
	<br>	MAYBE WE CAN SWING BY LATER
	<br>	OR SOMETHING--
	<br>	I'M NOT A STOP ALONG THE WAY.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M A DESTINATION,
	<br>	AND IF YOU REFUSE TO ATTEND,
	<br>
	<br>	I'M GONNA HAVE TO FIND
	<br>	A REPLACEMENT.
	<br>
	<br>	GIRLS, THE WAITING LIST.
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY. WELL, UH,
	<br>	I SHOULD GET GOING.
	<br>
	<br>	BYE.
	<br>	GOOD LUCK TONIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	THANK YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	LITTLE JENNY HUMPHREY. WHY
	<br>	DIDN'T I THINK OF YOU BEFORE?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU HAVE NO PLANS.
	<br>	YOU'RE COMING TO THE SOIREE.
	<br>
	<br>	ME? REALLY?
	<br>	HER? REALLY?
	<br>
	<br>	THE THING IS, IF YOU COME,
	<br>	YOU'LL HAVE TO BE UP
	<br>
	<br>	TO A LITTLE MORE
	<br>	THAN JUST SLEEPING.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M UP FOR ANYTHING.
	<br>
	<br>	MY PLACE. 7:00 SHARP.
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY. BYE.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, A GIRL'S FIRST SLEEPOVER--
	<br>
	<br>	SOMETHING SHE'LL NEVER FORGET.
	<br>
	<br>	LET'S MAKE SURE OF IT.
	<br>
	<br>	TAKING BETS
	<br>	ON HOW LONG SHE LASTS?
	<br>
	<br>	50 BUCKS SAY AN HOUR
	<br>	AND NOT 1 MINUTE MORE.
	<br>
	<br>	I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
	<br>	HE SAID I WAS READY.
	<br>
	<br>	WE TALKED ABOUT IT
	<br>	IN OUR SESSION THIS MORNING.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT HE SAID
	<br>
	<br>	IS THAT YOU COULD COME HOME,
	<br>	NOT THAT YOU SHOULD.
	<br>
	<br>	BUT, MOM, I THOUGHT--
	<br>	I DON'T WANNA ARGUE ABOUT THIS.
	<br>
	<br>	I NEED TIME TO THINK.
	<br>
	<br>	PLEASE.
	<br>	LOOK, I TOLD THE DOCTOR I WOULD
	<br>	TAKE IT UNDER ADVISEMENT.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU CAN'T JUST
	<br>	WALK OUT OF HERE ANYWAY.
	<br>
	<br>	THERE'S PAPERS
	<br>	THAT HAVE TO BE SIGNED,
	<br>
	<br>	RELEASE FORMS, INSURANCE--
	<br>	I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU. YOU WANT
	<br>	TO KEEP ME HERE FOREVER.
	<br>
	<br>	IF YOU STILL THINK
	<br>	I'M "KEEPING YOU HERE,"
	<br>
	<br>	THAT JUST PROVES HOW NOT READY
	<br>	YOU ARE TO COME HOME.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK, WE'LL TALK
	<br>	ABOUT THIS TOMORROW.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH.
	<br>	YEAH, YOU BET WE WILL.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY. HEY, UH,
	<br>	AM I EARLY OR...
	<br>
	<br>	UH...
	<br>	UM...
	<br>
	<br>	NO. NO, I, UH,
	<br>	I'M JUST RUNNING LATE.
	<br>
	<br>	COME IN.
	<br>
	<br>	UM... EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO
	<br>
	<br>	SLIP INTO SOMETHING
	<br>	LESS COMFORTABLE.
	<br>
	<br>	SURE, SURE.
	<br>
	<br>	TALK TO ME WHILE I CHANGE?
	<br>
	<br>	I WILL.
	<br>	OKAY.
	<br>
	<br>	SAY, IT'S A NICE PLACE
	<br>	THAT YOU AND...
	<br>
	<br>	800 OTHER PEOPLE
	<br>	HAVE GOT HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, THE, UH,
	<br>	IDENTICAL SURROUNDINGS
	<br>
	<br>	DO MAKE YOU CRAZY
	<br>	AFTER A LITTLE WHILE.
	<br>
	<br>	SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
	<br>
	<br>	I'M IN A SECRET
	<br>	GOVERNMENT EXPERIMENT.
	<br>
	<br>	MOST GOVERNMENT EXPERIMENTS
	<br>
	<br>	DON'T HAVE PLASMA TVs
	<br>	OR MAID SERVICES.
	<br>
	<br>	JUST SOMETHING I'VE NOTICED.
	<br>
	<br>	DAN.
	<br>
	<br>	DOES SERENA KNOW YOU'RE HERE?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, OF COURSE.
	<br>	YEAH, SHE LET ME IN.
	<br>
	<br>	AT LEAST,
	<br>	I HOPE THAT WAS HER.
	<br>
	<br>	SHE'S ABOUT, UH,
	<br>	YEA TALL AND VERY BLONDE?
	<br>
	<br>	IT MAKES JOKES. CUTE.
	<br>
	<br>	BIG SHOPPING DAY?
	<br>
	<br>	I HAD A LOT ON MY MIND.
	<br>
	<br>	SO WHERE ARE YOU
	<br>	TAKING MY DAUGHTER TONIGHT?
	<br>
	<br>	I... I DON'T KNOW.
	<br>
	<br>	I THOUGHT MAYBE WE'D DO A WALKING TOUR
	<br>	OF NEW YORK UNDERGROUND,
	<br>
	<br>	VISIT MY FRIENDS
	<br>	THE MOLE PEOPLE.
	<br>
	<br>	THEY'RE GREAT, EXCEPT THEY
	<br>	ONLY EVER EAT LEFTOVERS.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW WHY
	<br>	I JUST SAID ANY OF THAT.
	<br>
	<br>	I HAVE--I HAVE THIS THING,
	<br>	THIS NERVOUS TIC
	<br>
	<br>	WHERE I NEVER STOP SPEAKING,
	<br>	LIKE, EVER.
	<br>
	<br>	IN FACT, WHEN I WAS
	<br>	A LITTLE BOY, MY MOM USED TO SAY
	<br>
	<br>	THERE WAS NEVER A WORD I MET
	<br>	THAT I DIDN'T LIKE.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I LIKE?
	<br>
	<br>	YOUR DAUGHTER.
	<br>
	<br>	I-I REALLY LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER.
	<br>	I...
	<br>
	<br>	WOW.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU'RE NOT WEARING THAT
	<br>	WITH THAT, ARE YOU?
	<br>
	<br>	UH, MOM...
	<br>
	<br>	HERE. WAIT.
	<br>
	<br>	TAKE THIS.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, THANK YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY, UM, WHERE'S ERIC? I THOUGHT
	<br>	HE WAS GONNA BE HOME BY NOW.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, HE WAS TOO TIRED
	<br>	TO COME HOME TONIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	MOM.
	<br>
	<br>	LATER.
	<br>
	<br>	COME ON. LET'S GO.
	<br>
	<br>	HOME BY 1:00.
	<br>	BONUS POINTS FOR 12:45.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, MY GOD, A VESPA!
	<br>
	<br>	I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
	<br>	I LOVE VESPAS!
	<br>
	<br>	OH, MY GOSH.
	<br>	YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
	<br>
	<br>	I SPENT ONE OF MY FAVORITE
	<br>	SUMMERS RIDING ALL AROUND ITALY
	<br>
	<br>	ON ONE OF THESE.
	<br>	HOW DID YOU KNOW?
	<br>
	<br>	MY MOM WON'T LET ME
	<br>	LEARN TO DRIVE
	<br>
	<br>	'CAUSE SHE SAYS
	<br>	THAT'S WHAT DRIVERS ARE FOR,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT REALLY, DAN,
	<br>	THIS IS AMAZING. REALLY.
	<br>
	<br>	COME ON.
	<br>	WHERE ARE THE HELMETS?
	<br>
	<br>	MR. HUMPHREY.
	<br>
	<br>	IS HE--IS HE OURS?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH.
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY, GREAT.
	<br>
	<br>	SPOTTED ON THE STEPS
	<br>	OF THE PALACE--
	<br>
	<br>	CINDERELLA
	<br>	STEPPING ONTO A PUMPKIN
	<br>
	<br>	INSTEAD OF HER CARRIAGE.
	<br>
	<br>	LUCKY FOR LONELY BOY,
	<br>
	<br>	THERE'S MORE THAN ONE FABLE
	<br>	FILLING OUR IN-BOX.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S NOT BAD.
	<br>
	<br>	I WILL TAKE THAT
	<br>	FOR YOU, YES?
	<br>
	<br>	JENNY! OH, I'M SO GLAD
	<br>	YOU COULD MAKE IT.
	<br>
	<br>	HERE'S AN INSIDE TIP,
	<br>	LITTLE J.--
	<br>
	<br>	THE FASTER YOU RISE,
	<br>	THE HARDER YOU FALL.
	<br>
	<br>	HOPE THAT HELLO KITTY
	<br>	SLEEPING BAG
	<br>
	<br>	DOUBLES AS A PARACHUTE.
	<br>
	<br>	LET THE GAMES BEGIN.
	<br>
	<br>	UM,
	<br>	HOW'S THE BRAISED QUAIL?
	<br>
	<br>	VERY GOOD, SIR.
	<br>
	<br>	MM. OKAY.
	<br>	AND THE, UH, THE LAY-PIN?
	<br>
	<br>	LAH-PAN. IT'S DELIGHTFUL.
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY, WHAT IS THAT AGAIN?
	<br>	RABBIT, SIR.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, WELL,
	<br>	I WON'T BE HAVING THAT.
	<br>
	<br>	UM, HOW ABOUT CHICKEN?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH CHICKEN.
	<br>
	<br>	YES, SIR.
	<br>	THANK YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	MISS?
	<br>	UH, I'LL HAVE
	<br>	THE LOBSTER BISQUE
	<br>
	<br>	AND MUSCOVY DUCK, PLEASE.
	<br>
	<br>	THANK YOU.
	<br>	MERCI, MADEMOISELLE.
	<br>
	<br>	I CAN'T BELIEVE
	<br>	THE WAITER FORGOT ME.
	<br>
	<br>	I WAS--I WAS JUST HERE...
	<br>	THE OTHER DAY.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,
	<br>	I COME HERE FOR THE CROWD.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU WANNA PLAY
	<br>	"MISTRESS OR SECOND WIFE"?
	<br>
	<br>	BECAUSE IT'S HARDER
	<br>	THAN IT LOOKS. BELIEVE ME.
	<br>
	<br>	SO IS HER FACE.
	<br>
	<br>	UH, WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?
	<br>	I, UH...
	<br>
	<br>	I'M GONNA GO TO THE RESTROOM
	<br>	TO FRESHEN UP A LITTLE.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
	<br>	I THINK THE BATHROOMS ARE--
	<br>
	<br>	UH, DON'T WORRY.
	<br>	I'LL FIND THEM.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, EXCUSE ME, SIR.
	<br>
	<br>	UH, HOW MUCH IS THAT DUCK
	<br>	SHE JUST ORDERED?
	<br>
	<br>	$78, SIR.
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY, RIGHT. THANK YOU.
	<br>	UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
	<br>
	<br>	CAN YOU JUST CANCEL
	<br>	MY MAIN DISH,
	<br>
	<br>	AND I'LL JUST HAVE
	<br>	THE APPETIZER AS THE MAIN?
	<br>
	<br>	OF COURSE, SIR.
	<br>
	<br>	THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MERCI.
	<br>
	<br>	TOO BEYONC?
	<br>
	<br>	TOO MARY-KATE.
	<br>
	<br>	TOO HANNAH MONTANA.
	<br>
	<br>	WOW. EVEN I'M IMPRESSED.
	<br>
	<br>	UM, I DON'T KNOW.
	<br>
	<br>	I MEAN, DON'T REALLY...
	<br>	FEEL RIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, AS MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAYS,
	<br>	"FASHION KNOWS NOT OF COMFORT."
	<br>
	<br>	ALL THAT MATTERS
	<br>	IS THE FACE YOU SHOW THE WORLD,
	<br>
	<br>	AND YOUR FACE LOOKS LIKE
	<br>	IT'S GOING TO A BAT MITZVAH.
	<br>
	<br>	BUT BEFORE WE CONTINUE
	<br>	THE RENOVATION...
	<br>
	<br>	MARTINI.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, NO, THANKS.
	<br>	I DON'T LIKE VODKA.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, THAT'S NICE,
	<br>	BECAUSE THIS IS GIN,
	<br>
	<br>	AS IT SHOULD BE.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S A PARTY, JENNY.
	<br>
	<br>	EITHER SWALLOW THAT OR SWIPE
	<br>	YOUR METROCARD BACK HOME.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S UP TO YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE. WHO'S READY
	<br>	FOR A GAME OF "TRUTH OR DARE"?
	<br>
	<br>	OH, I LOVE "TRUTH OR DARE."
	<br>
	<br>	ONCE I HAD TO EAT
	<br>	AN ENTIRE BAG OF MARSHMALLOWS.
	<br>
	<br>	THAT'S NICE, LITTLE HUMPHREY,
	<br>	BUT, UM, THAT'S NOT HOW WE PLAY.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, HOW DO YOU PLAY?
	<br>
	<br>	I THINK I'LL GO TRUTH.
	<br>
	<br>	Hello? Hello?
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT AM I, A TEENAGER?
	<br>
	<br>	Hello?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, HEY,
	<br>	I MUST HAVE THE WRONG NUMBER.
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>	SORRY ABOUT THAT,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT I--I'M PRETTY SURE
	<br>	THIS IS THE RIGHT NUMBER.
	<br>
	<br>	Who are you
	<br>	trying to reach?
	<br>
	<br>	IS ALISON HUMPHREY THERE?
	<br>
	<br>	Hold on a second.
	<br>	She just got out of the shower.
	<br>
	<br>	Al? It's for you.
	<br>
	<br>	Who's calling?
	<br>
	<br>	RUFUS HUMPHREY.
	<br>	WHO IS THIS?
	<br>
	<br>	Alexander Bancroft,
	<br>
	<br>	uh, just her--just...
	<br>	I'm--I'm a friend.
	<br>
	<br>	SO AM I, IT SEEMS.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm here. I'm here. Hello?
	<br>
	<br>	THANK YOU.
	<br>

	<br>	ANY OF MY DINNER?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU ENTR?E WAS SO SMALL.
	<br>	NO, NO, NO, NO.
	<br>	IT WAS AMAZING.
	<br>
	<br>	I DIDN'T REALIZE,
	<br>	UH, FISH COULD BE CREAMED.
	<br>
	<br>	WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE
	<br>	THE DESSERT MENU?
	<br>
	<br>	OH, NO, THANK YOU.
	<br>	I THINK WE'RE FINE.
	<br>
	<br>	SURE YOU DON'T WANT DESSERT?
	<br>	YEAH.
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY, WELL, THEN WE'LL
	<br>	JUST GET THE CHECK, PLEASE.
	<br>
	<br>	UH, ACTUALLY I ALREADY
	<br>	TOOK CARE OF THAT EARLIER.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT?
	<br>	MM-HMM.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, I-I JUST CHARGED IT
	<br>	ON MY MOM'S CARD.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S--IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
	<br>	DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW, I CAN PAY. IT'S NOT
	<br>	LIKE I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, I'M--I'M SURE YOU DO.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU JUST SHOULDN'T HAVE
	<br>	TO SPEND IT HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
	<br>	DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?
	<br>
	<br>	NO. LOOK,
	<br>	I WANTED A DATE WITH YOU,
	<br>
	<br>	JUST NOT THE DATE
	<br>	YOU THOUGHT I WANTED.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S--IT'S FINE.
	<br>
	<br>	ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, THEN...
	<br>
	<br>	IF IT'S A REAL DAN HUMPHREY DATE
	<br>	THAT YOU WANT,
	<br>
	<br>	THEN IT'S
	<br>	A REAL DAN HUMPHREY DATE
	<br>
	<br>	THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET.
	<br>
	<br>	LET'S GO.
	<br>	REALLY?
	<br>
	<br>	YES. MADEMOISELLE.
	<br>
	<br>	SPOTTED FLEEING DESSERT--
	<br>
	<br>	S. AND LONELY BOY
	<br>	LIGHTER THAN AIR
	<br>
	<br>	AND HEADING DOWNTOWN.
	<br>
	<br>	IT WASN'T EASY GETTING
	<br>	THE ENTIRE UNIFORM, BUT...
	<br>
	<br>	DONE AND DONE.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT'S THE DOORMAN WEARING?
	<br>
	<br>	DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT,
	<br>	LITTLE J.
	<br>
	<br>	JUST DRINK UP.
	<br>	YOU'RE LAGGING BEHIND.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, MY PHONE.
	<br>
	<br>	"S.O.S. STILL IN PRISON."
	<br>
	<br>	IS THAT
	<br>	ERIC VAN DER WOODSEN?
	<br>
	<br>	I THOUGHT HE WENT HOME
	<br>	FOR THE WEEKEND.
	<br>
	<br>	GUESS IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
	<br>
	<br>	IS, WHY DON'T YOU
	<br>	TAKE THE GIRLS TO VISCONTI?
	<br>
	<br>	MEET YOU THERE IN AN HOUR?
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>	I DARE YOU
	<br>	TO JAILBREAK ERIC.
	<br>
	<br>	BLAIR.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S PERFECT. YOU WANT IN,
	<br>	AND HE WANTS OUT.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?
	<br>	DO OR DIE, LITTLE J.?
	<br>
	<br>	SPOTLIGHT ON LITTLE J,
	<br>
	<br>	NOW PUT TO THE TEST
	<br>	BY ONE QUEEN B.
	<br>
	<br>	WILL J. TAKE THE BAIT
	<br>	AND TURN FROM BRADY TO BRITNEY,
	<br>
	<br>	OR WILL
	<br>	HER GOODY TWO-SHOES MIND-SET
	<br>
	<br>	TURN INTO THE NIGHT'S
	<br>	BIGGEST BUZZ KILL?
	<br>
	<br>	Let's do it.
	<br>
	<br>	SURPRISE.
	<br>
	<br>	JENNY, HEY.
	<br>	WH--WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
	<br>
	<br>	YOUR S.O.S.
	<br>	WAS HEARD AND ANSWERED.
	<br>
	<br>	COME ON,
	<br>	WE'RE BREAKING YOU OUT.
	<br>
	<br>	WAIT, HOW...
	<br>
	<br>	WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WE"?
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY, I HAVE A PROBLEM.
	<br>
	<br>	I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM.
	<br>
	<br>	IT STARTS WITH A CAPITAL Rx.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT DRUGS
	<br>	HAVE YOU BEEN TAKING?
	<br>
	<br>	MM, CAFFEINE,
	<br>
	<br>	NICOTINE, KETAMINE,
	<br>
	<br>	G.H.B., P.C.P., L.S.D.,
	<br>
	<br>	DI--DRI--DIAZEPAM,

	<br>	LORAZEPAM.
	<br>
	<br>	ALL THE PAMS, REALLY.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW,
	<br>	I DON'T DISCRIMINATE.
	<br>
	<br>	APPARENTLY NOT.
	<br>
	<br>	CODE YELLOW, FLOOR SIX.
	<br>
	<br>	WHY DON'T YOU WAIT
	<br>	RIGHT HERE?
	<br>
	<br>	I'LL GET A DOCTOR.
	<br>
	<br>	AND I'D LOVE A CAPPUCCINO.
	<br>
	<br>	COME ON, LET'S GO.
	<br>
	<br>	I HEARD YOU WERE BORED,
	<br>	AND FIGURED I OWED YOU ONE.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, TRY 50.
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY, COME ON.
	<br>	GET A MOVE ON. COME ON.
	<br>
	<br>	HELLO?
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT?
	<br>
	<br>	HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? WH--
	<br>
	<br>	HE WAS WITH WHO?
	<br>
	<br>	YOUNG, BLONDE AND BEAUTIFUL.
	<br>	YEP,
	<br>
	<br>	THAT'S HIS SISTER.
	<br>
	<br>	I'LL FIND THEM.
	<br>
	<br>	THANK YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	AH, OF COURSE.
	<br>
	<br>	OOH! AND ANOTHER ONE.
	<br>
	<br>	SORRY, JOE.
	<br>
	<br>	THAT'S GAME.
	<br>
	<br>	UH, THAT'S 75 BUCKS.
	<br>	I THINK THAT PAYS FOR YOUR DUCK.
	<br>
	<br>	THAT IT DOES. THANK YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	SO WHAT NOW?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU PLAY ME.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, UNLESS YOU'RE AFRAID TO LOSE.
	<br>
	<br>	I THINK THE ONLY THING BEING LOST IN THIS GAME
	<br>	WOULD BE YOUR DIGNITY.
	<br>
	<br>	- OH, REALLY?
	<br>	- YES.
	<br>
	<br>	- YOU THINK SO?
	<br>	- I THINK SO.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, THEN RACK 'EM UP.
	<br>	I'LL BUY US A SOUNDTRACK.
	<br>
	<br>	THIS BETTER NOT BE MY WIFE.
	<br>
	<br>	RUFUS, DO YOU ALWAYS
	<br>	ANSWER THE PHONE LIKE THAT?
	<br>
	<br>	LILY?
	<br>
	<br>	LISTEN, I NEED YOUR SON'S CELL
	<br>	PHONE NUMBER. IT'S AN EMERGENCY.
	<br>
	<br>	A REAL EMERGENCY
	<br>	OR A LILY EMERGENCY?
	<br>
	<br>	ERIC IS MISSING.
	<br>
	<br>	MISSING?
	<br>
	<br>	FROM WHERE?
	<br>
	<br>	FROM...
	<br>
	<br>	HIS--HIS ROOM HERE...
	<br>
	<br>	at the hotel.
	<br>
	<br>	I--I'M TRYING
	<br>	TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT HE'S NOT ANSWERING HIS
	<br>	PHONE. I THINK HE'S WITH SERENA.
	<br>
	<br>	DID YOU TRY HER?
	<br>
	<br>	SHE LEFT HER PHONE HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	YOUR SON'S CELL NUMBER--
	<br>	THAT'S ALL I NEED.
	<br>
	<br>	THEY'RE ON A DATE, LIL.
	<br>
	<br>	IF THEY PICKED ERIC UP ALONG THE WAY,
	<br>
	<br>	I bet they're having fun.
	<br>
	<br>	I HAVE A SITUATION HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	A SITUATION? YOUR SON IS
	<br>	WITH YOUR DAUGHTER AND MY KID.
	<br>
	<br>	I TRUST THEM.
	<br>	WHY DON'T YOU?
	<br>
	<br>	RUFUS.
	<br>
	<br>	GOOD-BYE, LILY.
	<br>	ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY, BABY, YOU WANT TO, UH,
	<br>
	<br>	MAYBE SHOW ME TO THE BATHROOM,
	<br>
	<br>	GET LOST SOMEWHERE
	<br>	AROUND THE COAT CHECK?
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, MY ANSWER IS USUALLY
	<br>	"NEVER SAY NEVER,"
	<br>
	<br>	BUT FOR YOU,
	<br>	I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION.
	<br>
	<br>	OH!
	<br>
	<br>	WHO LET THE HEDGE FUND MAFIA
	<br>	IN HERE?
	<br>
	<br>	I THOUGHT MATCHY-MATCHY
	<br>	WAS OVER.
	<br>
	<br>	SO ERIC'S HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.
	<br>	TRUTH OR DARE?
	<br>
	<br>	DO YOU HAVE TO ASK?
	<br>
	<br>	I DARE YOU TO MAKE OUT WITH THAT GUY.
	<br>
	<br>	EASY.
	<br>
	<br>	AND MEAN IT.
	<br>
	<br>	WATCH AND LEARN,
	<br>	LITTLE HUMPHREY.
	<br>
	<br>	I HOPE AMANDA
	<br>	NEVER FINDS OUT.
	<br>
	<br>	WHO'S AMANDA?
	<br>
	<br>	JUST MY GIRLFRIEND.
	<br>
	<br>	AMANDA NEVER HAS TO KNOW,
	<br>	DOES SHE?
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, I'M NOT TELLING HER.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK WHAT I GOT.
	<br>
	<br>	I DARE YOU TO CALL HIS GIRLFRIEND.
	<br>
	<br>	HER NAME'S AMANDA.
	<br>
	<br>	DONE AND DONE.
	<br>
	<br>	HELLO?
	<br>
	<br>	AMANDA?
	<br>
	<br>	HI. THIS IS BL--
	<br>
	<br>	CLAIRE.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,
	<br>
	<br>	I JUST HAD MY TONGUE
	<br>	DOWN YOUR BOYFRIEND'S THROAT,
	<br>
	<br>	AND HE NEGLECTED TO TELL ME YOU EXISTED
	<br>	UNTIL AFTER IT WAS OVER.
	<br>
	<br>	JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.
	<br>
	<br>	HE'S A REAL CATCH.
	<br>
	<br>	BYE.
	<br>
	<br>	ALL RIGHT,
	<br>	SLEEPOVER OF THE YEAR.
	<br>
	<br>	WHOO!
	<br>
	<br>	HEY, EVERYBODY'S
	<br>	GOTTA START SOMEWHERE.
	<br>
	<br>	MAYBE LITTLE J.
	<br>	ISN'T SO LITTLE ANYMORE.
	<br>
	<br>	OH!
	<br>
	<br>	OH, NO!
	<br>
	<br>	GAME OVER.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU LOST FAIR AND SQUARE,
	<br>
	<br>	AND THAT'S SQUARED.
	<br>
	<br>	OH! AM I REALLY THAT BAD?
	<br>
	<br>	THERE AREN'T ENOUGH WORDS
	<br>	TO DESCRIBE THE KIND OF BAD YOU ARE.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, YOU PROMISED IF YOU
	<br>	LOST AGAIN, YOU'D TEACH ME.
	<br>
	<br>	ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	THAT'S A PROMISE I INTEND TO KEEP,
	<br>	NOT JUST FOR YOU,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT FOR DIVE BARS EVERYWHERE
	<br>	ALL ACROSS AMERICA.
	<br>
	<br>	ALL RIGHT, COME HERE.
	<br>
	<br>	NOW YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER,
	<br>	IN POOL, IT'S ALL ABOUT--
	<br>
	<br>	TAKE THIS STICK--
	<br>
	<br>	REMEMBER, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ANGLES,
	<br>	THE RIGHT ANGLE, OF COURSE.
	<br>
	<br>	- MM-HMM.
	<br>	- TAKE THE SHOT.
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY.
	<br>
	<br>	UM,
	<br>	BRING YOUR HAND BACK ...
	<br>
	<br>	- ... HERE.
	<br>	- RIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	AND, UH, WAIT.
	<br>	OH, OKAY. HOLD ON.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU GOTTA BE SLOW AND JUST FOLLOW THROUGH,
	<br>	ALL RIGHT?
	<br>
	<br>	OH!
	<br>
	<br>	OH! THIS IS MY SONG.
	<br>	FINALLY.
	<br>
	<br>	I DIDN'T KNOW YOU LIKED
	<br>	THIS KIND OF MUSIC.
	<br>
	<br>	I THINK WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED
	<br>	THE THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, OTH--OTHER THAN YOU'RE ...
	<br>
	<br>	TOTAL LACK OF POOLS SKILLS,
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT ELSE?
	<br>
	<br>	THAT I'M HAVING
	<br>	THE BEST TIME RIGHT NOW?
	<br>
	<br>	THAT I KNEW.
	<br>
	<br>	AHEM. THERE'S SOMETHING
	<br>	VIBRATING IN YOUR POCKET,
	<br>
	<br>	AND I REALLY HOPE IT'S YOUR PHONE.
	<br>
	<br>	HOLD ON.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, IT'S MY DAD.
	<br>
	<br>	HE KNOWS I'M WITH YOU.
	<br>	HE WOULDN'T CALL IF IT WASN'T IMPORTANT.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, YEAH, OF COURSE.
	<br>	TAKE IT.
	<br>
	<br>	HELLO?
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT?
	<br>	NO, NO, NO, HE'S NOT.
	<br>
	<br>	SERENA LEFT HER PHONE
	<br>	AT THE HOTEL?
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT? WHAT'S UP?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. DAD,
	<br>	SHE'S STANDING RIGHT HERE NEXT TO ME.
	<br>
	<br>	WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
	<br>
	<br>	WAIT, TAKE CARE OF WHAT?
	<br>
	<br>	SLIGHT CHANGE OF PLANS.
	<br>
	<br>	NO! NO, NO. NO CHANGE OF PLANS.
	<br>
	<br>	I LIKE THIS PLAN OF YOU
	<br>	TEACHING ME THE ANGLES.
	<br>
	<br>	I KNOW.
	<br>
	<br>	REMEMBER, CUTE GIRL
	<br>	WITH TOTAL LACK OF POOL SKILLS?
	<br>
	<br>	I REMEMBER.
	<br>
	<br>	SO DOES THE TABLE.
	<br>
	<br>	COME ON, WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY BE
	<br>	THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS RIGHT HERE?
	<br>
	<br>	CAN'T IT WAIT TILL TOMORROW?
	<br>
	<br>	ACTUALLY, IT CAN'T.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU NEED TO CALL
	<br>	YOUR BROTHER RIGHT NOW.
	<br>
	<br>	- HEY. I WAS JUST ABOUT--
	<br>	- SO I MADE SOME CALLS,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT AS IT TURNS OUT, NONE OF MY PEOPLE KNOW
	<br>	YOUR PEOPLE. SHOCKING, BUT TRUE.
	<br>
	<br>	EITHER "DAN HUMPHREY" IS AN ALIAS
	<br>	OR YOUR SON IS NOT VERY POPULAR.
	<br>
	<br>	REGARDLESS,
	<br>	I NEED THAT NUMBER.
	<br>
	<br>	I REALIZED WHEN I GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH YOU
	<br>
	<br>	THAT I COULD'VE BEEN
	<br>	A LITTLE BIT MORE UNDERSTANDING.
	<br>
	<br>	- YOU THINK--
	<br>	- I CALLED DAN.
	<br>
	<br>	THANK YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	AND YOUR SON'S
	<br>	NOT WITH THEM.
	<br>
	<br>	HE'S NOT?
	<br>
	<br>	BUT SERENA GOT ERIC
	<br>	ON THE PHONE, AND HE'S OKAY,
	<br>
	<br>	AND DAN SAID THEY WOULD PHONE
	<br>	WHEN THEY WERE ALL TOGETHER.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH,
	<br>
	<br>	AND YOU DIDN'T THINK
	<br>	TO CALL AND TELL ME ALL OF THIS?
	<br>
	<br>	I WAS JUST ABOUT TO.
	<br>
	<br>	NOW I HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT WHY
	<br>	DON'T YOU SIT AND WAIT HERE?
	<br>
	<br>	WE SHOULD HEAR FROM THEM SOON.
	<br>
	<br>	FINE.
	<br>
	<br>	AND I'LL PASS ON A GLASS OF THAT
	<br>	NONPREMIUM LIQUOR THAT YOU'RE DRINKING.
	<br>
	<br>	BUT I WILL TAKE
	<br>	SOMETHING TO EAT.
	<br>
	<br>	THANK YOU FOR OFFERING.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT? YOU STILL KNOW
	<br>	HOW TO COOK, DON'T YOU?
	<br>
	<br>	DO YOU SEE JENNY
	<br>	OR YOUR BROTHER?
	<br>
	<br>	NO.
	<br>
	<br>	ARE YOU HER?
	<br>	ARE YOU CLAIRE?
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT? NO.
	<br>
	<br>	UH, ARE YOU SURE
	<br>	WE'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH.

	<br>	EXCUSE ME. HELLO.
	<br>
	<br>	- WHERE'S MY PHONE?
	<br>	- HEY, HEY, LET GO OF HER.
	<br>
	<br>	- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
	<br>	- YOUR PHONE IS AT OUR TABLE.
	<br>
	<br>	IF YOU WEREN'T SO DRUNK AND DROOLING OVER
	<br>	EVERY GIRL IN THIS PLACE,
	<br>
	<br>	- YOU WOULD'VE SEEN THAT.
	<br>	- I'M GONNA KILL YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, YOU MUST BE AMANDA, RIGHT?
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, I WOULD THINK TWICE
	<br>	BEFORE MARRYING HIM 'CAUSE HE'S A PIG.
	<br>
	<br>	WAIT. HEY, HEY.
	<br>	BACK OFF OF HER, OKAY?
	<br>
	<br>	I DON'T NEED YOU TO DEFEND ME.
	<br>
	<br>	IT WASN'T EVEN HER WHO CALLED YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	IT WAS ME.
	<br>
	<br>	- JENNY?
	<br>	- SO SHE'S THE ONE WITH THE TONGUE?
	<br>
	<br>	TONGUE?
	<br>
	<br>	TONGUE--
	<br>	WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING HERE?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AT A SLEEPOVER.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU MADE OUT WITH A GIRL FROM A ????
	<br>
	<br>	YOU MADE OUT WITH HIM?
	<br>	WAIT, I MADE OUT WITH HER.
	<br>
	<br>	IT WAS A DARE.
	<br>
	<br>	A DARE?
	<br>	WHAT ARE YOU, CHILDREN?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, PRETTY MUCH. SHE'S 14?!
	<br>
	<br>	- 14?!
	<br>	- 14?!
	<br>
	<br>	JESUS. NO, I SWEAR I HAD NO IDEA, BABY.
	<br>
	<br>	I MEAN, LOOK AT HER. I MEAN, SHE'S JAILBAIT.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT--WHAT'S THAT?
	<br>
	<br>	DAN, STAY OUT OF IT, OKAY?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU'RE JUST CAUSING MORE PROBLEMS
	<br>	THAN YOU'RE SOLVING.
	<br>
	<br>	THE ONLY THING IS THE COCKTAIL NAPKIN
	<br>	YOU'RE WEARING.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU GOT IT.
	<br>	THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING.
	<br>
	<br>	DAN! HEY!
	<br>
	<br>	ALL RIGHT, ALL YOU OUT
	<br>	BEFORE I CALL THE COPS.
	<br>
	<br>	ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY, SERENA.
	<br>
	<br>	SEE? I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.
	<br>
	<br>	LET'S GO, COME ON.
	<br>
	<br>	ERIC, COME ON.
	<br>
	<br>	SPOTTED--
	<br>
	<br>	BIG BROTHER
	<br>	TO THE NOT-QUITE RESCUE.
	<br>
	<br>	TOO BAD NO ONE TOLD HIM YOU CAN'T SAVE
	<br>	A DAMSEL IF SHE LOVES HER DISTRESS.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE SAUCE?
	<br>
	<br>	MM, OH, NOTHING, I'M JUST SO HAPPY
	<br>	TO HAVE A HOME-COOKED MEAL.
	<br>
	<br>	- IT JUST NEEDS A LITTLE SALT.
	<br>	- WHAT? IT'S PERFECT.
	<br>
	<br>	NO, JUST A--JUST A PINCH.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.
	<br>	YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE IN CONTROL.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, I DON'T REMEMBER
	<br>	YOU COMPLAINING.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, I WASN'T ALLOWED TO.
	<br>	IT WAS ONE OF YOUR RULES.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, WELL, I MAY HOLD
	<br>	THE REINS A LITTLE TIGHT,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT LIFE IS COMPLICATED,
	<br>	ESPECIALLY ONCE YOU HAVE KIDS.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY'RE LITTLE,
	<br>	YOU'RE THEIR WHOLE WORLD.
	<br>
	<br>	AND THEN ONE DAY,
	<br>	THE WALL GOES UP,
	<br>
	<br>	AND YOU'RE ON ONE SIDE,
	<br>	AND THEY'RE ON THE OTHER.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, THEY DON'T LIKE
	<br>	TO ADMIT IT,
	<br>
	<br>	- BUT THEY WANT US TO BREAK THROUGH.
	<br>	- YEAH, WELL, MAYBE SERENA,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT ERIC-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTS.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU'RE OFF CONCERNING ABOUT
	<br>	A 14-YEAR-OLD BOY BREAKING CURFEW.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, IT'S NOT MY CURFEW
	<br>	HE'S BREAKING.
	<br>
	<br>	HE'S BEEN STAYING
	<br>	AT THE OSTROFF CENTER.
	<br>
	<br>	- OSTROFF CENTER?
	<br>	- MM-HMM. YEAH.
	<br>
	<br>	IS IT DRUGS? DRINKING?
	<br>
	<br>	UM, NO,
	<br>	HE'S NOT A BAD KID.
	<br>
	<br>	HE'S JUST--JUST, UM,
	<br>
	<br>	A LONELY ONE.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S DEPRESSION?
	<br>
	<br>	IS IT BAD?
	<br>
	<br>	BAD ENOUGH
	<br>	TO TRY TO KILL HIMSELF.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M SORRY.
	<br>
	<br>	NO, I DON'T KNOW WHY.
	<br>
	<br>	I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID
	<br>	OR I DIDN'T DO, BUT...
	<br>
	<br>	I JUST DON'T KNOW
	<br>	WHAT TO DO TO--
	<br>
	<br>	TO MAKE SURE
	<br>	IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
	<br>
	<br>	ALL YOU CAN DO
	<br>	IS BE THERE FOR THEM.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, I HOPE THAT'S DAN
	<br>	OR SERENA.
	<br>
	<br>	HELLO?
	<br>
	<br>	HEY, GREAT.
	<br>
	<br>	UH, YEAH.
	<br>
	<br>	ACTUALLY, I CAN TELL HER.
	<br>	HIS MOTHER'S HERE WITH ME.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S A LONG STORY.
	<br>
	<br>	SOUNDS GOOD. TAKE CARE.
	<br>
	<br>	SO HE'S WITH DAN AND SERENA,
	<br>
	<br>	AND EVERYONE'S FINE.
	<br>
	<br>	ALL RIGHT,
	<br>	I SHOULD GO MEET THEM.
	<br>
	<br>	I'LL WRAP THIS UP.
	<br>
	<br>	NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
	<br>	THIS ISN'T GONNA TRAVEL WELL.
	<br>
	<br>	WHY DON'T I JUST STAY HERE
	<br>	AND I CAN EAT IT QUICKLY?
	<br>
	<br>	IT WOULD BE A SHAME
	<br>	TO LET IT GO TO WASTE.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
	<br>
	<br>	HE WAS BORED.
	<br>
	<br>	HE WANTED TO GET OUT AND HAVE SOME FUN.
	<br>
	<br>	SO YOU TOOK HIM TO A BAR?
	<br>
	<br>	HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.
	<br>
	<br>	I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, I'M NOT, OKAY?
	<br>	I-I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU DID THIS.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY, I WASN'T KIDNAPPED, SERENA.
	<br>
	<br>	I LEFT OF MY OWN FREE WILL.
	<br>
	<br>	BLAIR WAS TRYING TO DO ME A FAVOR.
	<br>
	<br>	TOLD YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, IT'S NO FAVOR, ERIC.
	<br>	YOU'RE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, I KNOW,
	<br>
	<br>	AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
	<br>	IT WAS WORTH IT...
	<br>
	<br>	TO BE OUT AFTER DARK
	<br>
	<br>	AND TO TALK TO SOMEONE
	<br>	WHO ISN'T JUST YOU OR MOM,
	<br>
	<br>	EVEN IF IT IS BLAIR.
	<br>
	<br>	NO OFFENSE.
	<br>
	<br>	NONE TAKEN.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, I'M SORRY
	<br>	THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY.
	<br>
	<br>	WE'LL WORK ON MOM, OKAY?
	<br>
	<br>	THANKS.
	<br>
	<br>	AND SINCE SHE KNOWS
	<br>	YOU'RE OKAY,
	<br>
	<br>	I GUESS THERE'S
	<br>	NO REAL REASON TO RUSH.
	<br>
	<br>	HOW ABOUT WE WALK?
	<br>
	<br>	OH, CALL ME.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, I WILL.
	<br>
	<br>	I WAS TALKING TO ERIC.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
	<br>	THIS IS NOT WHO YOU ARE.
	<br>
	<br>	AND WHO ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?
	<br>	DAD?
	<br>
	<br>	UH, WE ARE NOT
	<br>	DOING THIS RIGHT NOW.
	<br>
	<br>	WE CAN DO THIS AT HOME.
	<br>	LET'S GO.
	<br>
	<br>	EXCEPT I'M NOT GOING HOME.
	<br>	I'M GOING WITH MY FRIENDS.
	<br>
	<br>	COMING, JENNY?
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH. ONE SECOND.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK, ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY THAT THINGS
	<br>	GOT OUT OF HAND TONIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	TO SAY THE LEAST.
	<br>
	<br>	I KNOW WHO BLAIR AND THOSE GIRLS ARE,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT I KNOW WHO I AM,
	<br>
	<br>	AND I'M NOT GONNA FORGET THAT
	<br>	JUST 'CAUSE I HANG OUT WITH THEM.
	<br>
	<br>	COME ON! WE'RE LEAVING!
	<br>
	<br>	I'M COMING!
	<br>
	<br>	JUST LET ME GO. PLEASE?
	<br>
	<br>	I MEAN, LOOK, I'LL BE TUCKED
	<br>	IN BED IN A HALF-HOUR.
	<br>
	<br>	I PROMISE.
	<br>
	<br>	UH, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
	<br>	ALL RIGHT. YEAH, GO AHEAD.
	<br>
	<br>	THANK YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY.
	<br>
	<br>	I, UH, I GOTTA TAKE HIM
	<br>	BACK TO THE CENTER.
	<br>
	<br>	SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY JUST CALL IT A NIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT? NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
	<br>	I'LL GO WITH YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	NO, IT'S OKAY.
	<br>	YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
	<br>
	<br>	I WANT TO.
	<br>
	<br>	COME ON. LET'S GO.
	<br>
	<br>	THIS JUST IN--"TRUTH OR DARE"
	<br>	HAS GONE INTO OVERTIME.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOKS LIKE
	<br>	NO ONE TOLD LITTLE J.
	<br>
	<br>	THAT YOU DON'T BEAT A WALDORF
	<br>	AT HER OWN GAME.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU WANT ME TO STEAL
	<br>	THE JACKET FROM THE MANNEQUIN?
	<br>
	<br>	THAT'S RIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	BLAIR,
	<br>	IT'S YOUR MOM'S STORE.
	<br>
	<br>	I MEAN, YOU COULD HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT.
	<br>
	<br>	SO CAN YOU...
	<br>
	<br>	UNLESS YOU DON'T WANT TO,
	<br>
	<br>	WHICH IS TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE,
	<br>
	<br>	AND I WOULDN'T JUDGE YOU
	<br>	FOR THAT.
	<br>
	<br>	I DON'T GET IT.
	<br>
	<br>	THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S JUST A SHAME,
	<br>	'CAUSE YOU'VE COME SO FAR.
	<br>
	<br>	THE JACKET?
	<br>
	<br>	JUST THE JACKET.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, GOD.
	<br>
	<br>	FIVE, FOUR, THREE,
	<br>
	<br>	TWO, ONE.
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY, COME ON, RUN.
	<br>
	<br>	GUYS! COME BACK! LET ME OUT!
	<br>
	<br>	ARE YOU STILL THE SAME GUY
	<br>	YOU WERE WHEN I TOOK THIS PHOTO?
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT? YOU TOOK THAT PHOTO?
	<br>	YOU WEREN'T EVEN AT THAT SHOW.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, EXCUSE ME.
	<br>
	<br>	IF I REMEMBER,
	<br>	THE FIRST SONG WAS ABOUT ME,
	<br>
	<br>	THE SECOND ONE
	<br>	WAS ABOUT ...
	<br>
	<br>	YOUR MOTORCYCLE
	<br>
	<br>	AND THEN THERE WAS THE ONE ABOUT
	<br>	THAT SURF TOWN. WHAT WAS IT?
	<br>
	<br>	SAYULITA.
	<br>
	<br>	FISHERMEN'S TOWN.
	<br>
	<br>	WAS THAT THE ONE
	<br>	WITH THE VILLA WHERE WE...
	<br>
	<br>	YES, INDEED, IT WAS.
	<br>
	<br>	GOD, I MUST HAVE TAKEN
	<br>	EIGHT ROLLS OF FILM THAT NIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	WH--WHY DID YOU
	<br>	GIVE UP PHOTOGRAPHY ANYWAY?
	<br>
	<br>	YOU LOVED IT SO MUCH.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,
	<br>	I GUESS I FIGURED, UM,
	<br>
	<br>	SOCIAL CLIMBING
	<br>	WOULD BE MORE FULFILLING.
	<br>
	<br>	I EVEN REMEMBER THE BLACK DRESS
	<br>	I WORE THAT NIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	- REALLY?
	<br>	- YEAH.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW, I THINK
	<br>	IT MAY HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN BLUE.
	<br>
	<br>	I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
	<br>	REMEMBER ME BEING THERE.
	<br>
	<br>	UH, CAN YOU GRAB THAT, LIL?
	<br>	AND IF IT'S MY SON
	<br>
	<br>	BE NICE TO HIM.
	<br>
	<br>	HELLO, HUMPHREY RESIDENCE.
	<br>
	<br>	HI, ALISON.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, IT'S, UM, LILY.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH. H-HOLD ON. JUST...
	<br>
	<br>	ALISON?
	<br>
	<br>	LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
	<br>	SOME EXPLAINING TO DO.
	<br>
	<br>	TRUST ME, I DON'T OWE ALISON
	<br>	ANY EXPLANATION RIGHT NOW.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW WHAT?
	<br>	I'VE OVERSTAYED MY WELCOME.
	<br>
	<br>	OKAY.
	<br>
	<br>	I HOPE EVERYTHING
	<br>	TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH, ME, TOO.
	<br>
	<br>	THANKS FOR BABYSITTING ME,
	<br>
	<br>	AND THANK YOU FOR BEING
	<br>	SUCH A GOOD FRIEND.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH.
	<br>
	<br>	IT WAS ALMOST FUN.
	<br>
	<br>	GOOD NIGHT, RUFUS.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO SHOW ME SOME FORM
	<br>	OF IDENTIFICATION, MISS.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M ONLY 14.
	<br>
	<br>	I DON'T HAVE ANY.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT
	<br>	AT THIS HOUR?
	<br>
	<br>	- I, UM...
	<br>	- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
	<br>
	<br>	MY NAME IS BLAIR WALDORF.
	<br>
	<br>	THIS IS MY MOTHER'S SHOP.
	<br>
	<br>	HER NAME IS ELEANOR.
	<br>
	<br>	I LEFT MY JACKET HERE EARLIER,
	<br>
	<br>	I MEAN--WHICH IRRITATES
	<br>	MY MOTHER TO NO END.
	<br>
	<br>	AND I COMPLETELY FORGOT
	<br>	ABOUT THE ALARM.
	<br>
	<br>	ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S YOUR HOME
	<br>	PHONE NUMBER SO WE CAN CALL HER?
	<br>
	<br>	OH, SHE'S NOT HOME. I MEAN,
	<br>	SHE'S IN PARIS UNTIL THURSDAY.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S SIX HOURS AHEAD
	<br>	IF YOU WANT TO CALL.
	<br>
	<br>	SHE'S GONNA BE SO ANGRY.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, LOOK, WE CAN'T JUST LET YOU GO
	<br>	WITHOUT CONFIRMING YOUR STORY.
	<br>
	<br>	I HAVE MY OWN SET OF KEYS.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU CAN WATCH ME LOCK UP.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, I CAN SEE WHY YOUR BROTHER
	<br>	WOULD WANT TO LEAVE.
	<br>
	<br>	THAT PLACE IS, UH,
	<br>	IS VERY DEPRESSING.
	<br>
	<br>	AND YET, IT'S DESIGNED
	<br>	TO TREAT DEPRESSION.
	<br>
	<br>	HE'S A GOOD KID--ERIC.
	<br>	HE IS.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH.
	<br>
	<br>	JENNY'S NOT SO BAD EITHER.
	<br>
	<br>	YEAH?
	<br>
	<br>	- YEAH.
	<br>	- YEAH, I-I-I KNOW. I KNOW.
	<br>
	<br>	I JUST WORRY
	<br>	ABOUT HER SOMETIMES.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL,
	<br>	WORRY LOOKS CUTE ON YOU.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOK, I'VE SEEN
	<br>	JENNY IN ACTION,
	<br>
	<br>	AND MY HUNCH IS
	<br>
	<br>	SHE DOESN'T LET HERSELF GET PUSHED
	<br>	IN ANYTHING SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO.
	<br>
	<br>	NO, I-I KNOW. I KNOW.
	<br>	IT'S JUST...
	<br>
	<br>	SHE'S NEVER MENTIONED THAT
	<br>	HER IDEA OF A GREAT FRIDAY NIGHT
	<br>
	<br>	CONSISTS OF PAINTING HER FACE
	<br>	FULL OF MAKEUP,
	<br>
	<br>	AND STUMBLING OUT TO A HIP BAR
	<br>	IN HIGH HEELS
	<br>
	<br>	AND HANGING OUT WITH A BUNCH
	<br>	OF DRUNK WALL STREETERS
	<br>
	<br>	WHO DON'T EVEN CARE IF SHE HAS A NAME.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, MAYBE THAT WASN'T HER IDEA
	<br>	FOR A GREAT FRIDAY NIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S OKAY FOR HER TO WANT TO BE FRIENDS
	<br>	WITH THE PEOPLE SHE GOES TO SCHOOL WITH.
	<br>
	<br>	WHY?
	<br>
	<br>	I'M NOT.
	<br>
	<br>	AND IF YOU MADE
	<br>	HALF THE EFFORT SHE DID,
	<br>
	<br>	MAYBE WE WOULD'VE MET
	<br>	A LONG TIME AGO.
	<br>
	<br>	THAT'S TRUE.
	<br>
	<br>	THEN SO MAYBE YOU WOULD'VE
	<br>	KISSED ME ALREADY.
	<br>
	<br>	NO FIVE-STAR RESTAURANTS.
	<br>
	<br>	NO TOWN CAR.
	<br>
	<br>	NO SMOKY POOL HALL
	<br>	OR BAD '80s MUSIC.
	<br>
	<br>	LOOKS LIKE WE FINALLY FOUND
	<br>	COMMON GROUND.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY, MOM.
	<br>
	<br>	SORRY ABOUT TONIGHT.
	<br>
	<br>	NO, WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
	<br>	IN THE MORNING,
	<br>
	<br>	AFTER YOU'VE HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S
	<br>	SLEEP IN YOUR OWN BED.
	<br>
	<br>	I'M GOING HOME?
	<br>
	<br>	I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW
	<br>	THIS IS GONNA WORK, YOU KNOW.
	<br>
	<br>	HEY, I'M NOT WORRIED.
	<br>
	<br>	IT'S A GOOD THING
	<br>	I DIDN'T UNPACK.
	<br>
	<br>	CATCH.
	<br>
	<br>	JENNY?
	<br>
	<br>	LOOKS LIKE
	<br>	YOU CAME TO PLAY AFTER ALL.
	<br>
	<br>	YOU KNOW WHICH TRUNDLE BED
	<br>	IS YOURS.
	<br>
	<br>	SLEEP TIGHT.
	<br>	YOU'VE EARNED IT.
	<br>
	<br>	ACTUALLY, I'M GOING HOME,
	<br>
	<br>	BUT, UH,
	<br>
	<br>	THANKS FOR INVITING ME.
	<br>	IT WAS A BLAST.
	<br>
	<br>	WHAT DO YOU MEAN
	<br>	YOU'RE GOING HOME?
	<br>
	<br>	NOBODY EVER
	<br>	LEAVES A SLEEPOVER.
	<br>
	<br>	WELL, I GUESS THERE'S FIRSTS
	<br>	FOR EVERYTHING.
	<br>
	<br>	OH, AND I'M KEEPING
