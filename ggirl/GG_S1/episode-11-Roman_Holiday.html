<h1>Gossip Girl Season 1 -  11 - ROMAN HOLIDAY    </h1>



<div class="full-script">
	<br>	Gossip girl here
	<br>
	<br>	Your one and the only source
	<br>
	<br>	Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
	<br>
	<br>	How's your mom doing? my dad left her for another man.
	<br>
	<br>	Something about uh--uh, mom and a neighbor? yeah. it's complicated.
	<br>
	<br>	Mom's having an affair. it's easy for me to say it. it happened one time,
	<br>
	<br>	And it's over.
	<br>
	<br>	Then why did our daughter have to go to Hudson
	<br>
	<br>	And drag you back here? I'm sorry I kissed you, but I did it
	<br>
	<br>	Because I thought he should know how it feels to lose you.
	<br>
	<br>	So when can we go public?
	<br>
	<br>	My kids have to know first.
	<br>
	<br>	My friend Vanessa--she moved away to vermont last year,
	<br>
	<br>	And now she's back. you guys just have everything in common,
	<br>
	<br>	And, um, I'm just getting to know him.
	<br>
	<br>	This thing between us-- it's over fogood.
	<br>
	<br>	Nate is a gentleman. he would never cause a scene.
	<br>
	<br>	Where to, mr. Bass? the airport.
	<br>
	<br>	==========??????????̳ www.YYeTs.net=============
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, upper east siders. it's christmas in new york,
	<br>
	<br>	And along with the season
	<br>
	<br>	Comes the constance billard/ st. jude's bazaar,
	<br>
	<br>	Where the only thing bizarre are the donated items for sale.
	<br>
	<br>	How about an antique butter churn?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, my gosh. that would go so well with my loom.
	<br>
	<br>	I know what I'm getting you for christmas now. all right.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, for when I move to siberia?
	<br>
	<br>	No. come on. new york hardly even gets cold anymore,
	<br>
	<br>	And it never snows. who wants chestnuts
	<br>
	<br>	Roasted on an open fire when it feels like florida? okay,
	<br>
	<br>	Global warming grinch.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm just saying, christmas should be white and snowy.
	<br>
	<br>	I'd even settle for manhattan slush. mm.
	<br>
	<br>	There you are.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, Vanessa. what are you doing here? hey.
	<br>
	<br>	Merry christmas. this is a copy of "the new yorker."
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you, but you know I already have a subscription.
	<br>
	<br>	There's something else in there--a letter.
	<br>
	<br>	What does it say, Serena?
	<br>
	<br>	"dear mr. Humphrey, we are pleased to advise you
	<br>
	<br>	"that we would like to publish your short story
	<br>
	<br>	In our summer fiction issue featuring '20 under 20.'"
	<br>
	<br>	It's a contest for young unknown writers, and I might have...
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, my god! submitted you.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm gonna be published in "the new yorker." that--oh.
	<br>
	<br>	This ca--this can't be real. is--is this--is this real? this is so great.
	<br>
	<br>	I haven't even read one of your stories. oh, don't worry.
	<br>
	<br>	He doesn't show them to anyone.
	<br>
	<br>	I swiped this one out of his drawer on the pretense
	<br>
	<br>	Of borrowing a stapler.
	<br>
	<br>	Of borrowing slick. you never did return that stapler,
	<br>
	<br>	By the way.
	<br>
	<br>	Let's see. you story is called "10-8-05."
	<br>
	<br>	What's that date?
	<br>
	<br>	Vanessa, thank you. I don't know how you did this,
	<br>
	<br>	But this is the best present ever.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe we just took a cab for $32.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, I can't believe you were gonna wait an hour
	<br>
	<br>	For another subway. they said another train was on its way.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, excuse me. pardon me. oh.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh. Rufus, Alison, hello.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, Rufus.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, you remember my friend Bartholomew Bass?
	<br>
	<br>	Hi. from, uh, Eleanor's? yeah. hello.
	<br>
	<br>	Eleanor's? oh, this is my wife alison.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi. how do you do?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, it's lovely to see you both.
	<br>
	<br>	Excuse us, please.
	<br>
	<br>	I guess Lily's targeted her next billionaire.
	<br>
	<br>	Actually, I think she's had him in her sights for a while.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, that was awkward. it wouldn't be
	<br>
	<br>	If you let people know what we were doing together.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm just starting to trust you again.
	<br>
	<br>	And the only reason you didn't trust me last time
	<br>
	<br>	Was because of a misunderstanding. yes, and to avoid another one,
	<br>
	<br>	Please understand
	<br>
	<br>	That if it doesn't work out between us again,
	<br>
	<br>	I'm gonna feel twice as humiliated.
	<br>
	<br>	Not telling people about us ensures that we don't work out.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, when I committed myself to you, I meant it.
	<br>
	<br>	You know I am in love with you.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you waiting for?
	<br>
	<br>	Blair.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, happy holidays.
	<br>
	<br>	Happy holidays--mwah-- ms. Van Der Woodsen.
	<br>
	<br>	Mr. Bass, I didn't think that you were still in town.
	<br>
	<br>	I figured that you were with... with charles? no. sadly,
	<br>
	<br>	I am stuck here on business
	<br>
	<br>	While he suns himself at my hotel in monaco.
	<br>
	<br>	I have my staff keeping an eye on him,
	<br>
	<br>	And I'll join him for new year's.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, right. i-i, uh, was wondering
	<br>
	<br>	Why he'd been so quiet, and monaco answers my question.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	Lovely to see you two. bye. you, too.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair, there you are.
	<br>
	<br>	I-i can't talk right now, Serena. I'm late,
	<br>
	<br>	And I have-- a huge sweet tooth?
	<br>
	<br>	They're for my dad and me. we get them every year,
	<br>
	<br>	And he landed om parar 27 minutes ago. oh, then vite, vite!
	<br>
	<br>	I'll parle while you marche.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on. I said vite!
	<br>
	<br>	Nice holiday spirit, scrooge!
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, gosh. so it's gonna be a real Waldorf christmas?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, a real Waldorf christmas eve.
	<br>
	<br>	Eleanor drew the line at christmas day.
	<br>
	<br>	That's only for me, her and Dorota. well,
	<br>
	<br>	You still have a couple days with your dad.
	<br>
	<br>	No, it'll be more than just a couple days.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm gonna convince him to stay in new york. what about paris and roman?
	<br>
	<br>	roman is a phase. my father belongs here with me.
	<br>
	<br>	He only left new york to ride out the scandal. oh!
	<br>
	<br>	Time to come home, don't you think?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, did you want to ask me something? yes,
	<br>
	<br>	A gift idea for dan now that Vanessa got him
	<br>
	<br>	The most thoughtful dan-like present ever.
	<br>
	<br>	Why don't you just buy him a new outfit for cedric
	<br>
	<br>	And call it a day? thank you for being totally not helpful at all.
	<br>
	<br>	See you tomorrow night.
	<br>
	<br>	Bye.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair-bear!
	<br>
	<br>	Oh! oh, look at you.
	<br>
	<br>	Mm. more beautiful than ever.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, sweetheart,
	<br>
	<br>	You remember roman?
	<br>
	<br>	Blair.
	<br>
	<br>	You are still perfection.
	<br>
	<br>	Delicate, yet full with flavor,
	<br>
	<br>	Like a macaron.
	<br>
	<br>	Imagine my surprise when the elevator door opened
	<br>
	<br>	And out popped both of 'em.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, I didn't think you'd mind.
	<br>
	<br>	It's the perfect opportunity
	<br>
	<br>	For you two to get to know each another better.
	<br>
	<br>	Absolutely. it's for you. oh, sweetheart, you remembered.
	<br>
	<br>	It, uh, our tradition.
	<br>
	<br>	That's for you.
	<br>
	<br>	Merci, Blair.
	<br>
	<br>	My pleasure.
	<br>
	<br>	My son, the writer.
	<br>
	<br>	Published writer. yeah, you got your dream girl
	<br>
	<br>	And your story in "the new yorker."
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe you should just die now. that's true. I may have peaked.
	<br>
	<br>	This one is from the Smiths.
	<br>
	<br>	"season's greetings." that's very original.
	<br>
	<br>	Their name's Smith. they don't have to be original.
	<br>
	<br>	This one is from, uh, Alex.
	<br>
	<br>	What?
	<br>
	<br>	"Alison, meet--meet me on the 24th for--" no, Dan.
	<br>
	<br>	And that's not a christmas card.
	<br>
	<br>	Why is he writing to you?
	<br>
	<br>	Sending cards to the house? asking to see you?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't kn.w
	<br>
	<br>	Guys, we're--we're still here. we can hear you.
	<br>
	<br>	Rufus, it's over with Alex, okay?
	<br>
	<br>	I-i-i'm home now with my family.
	<br>
	<br>	Good.
	<br>
	<br>	Let's all rewind and just pretend this never happened.
	<br>
	<br>	This is not gonna ruin our christmas. hmm?
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe you're okay with this. who said I am okay with this?
	<br>
	<br>	What am I supposed to do, make a scene?
	<br>
	<br>	Behave like some pathetic, scorned wife? no.
	<br>
	<br>	roman does not even know how to ice-skate.
	<br>
	<br>	Can't you escort him out of the park On your way to the meeting?
	<br>
	<br>	maybe drop him at a nail salon?
	<br>
	<br>	I cannot bother myself trying to wrestle roman away from you.
	<br>
	<br>	I have to mentally prepare.
	<br>
	<br>	I am meeting with the c.e.o. of victoria's secret, after all.
	<br>
	<br>	Victoria's secret?
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, I'm-- I'm designing a line
	<br>
	<br>	Of retro-chic sleepwear and lingerie
	<br>
	<br>	and i-- I'm looking forward to the Samples.
	<br>
	<br>	We're all very proud.
	<br>
	<br>	In fact, mom, why don't you tell roman all about it? oh, yes.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sure he'd be fascinated.
	<br>
	<br>	It's so good to have you here. well, it's good to be here.
	<br>
	<br>	Now where's the handsome Nate? am I gonna see him tonight? well,
	<br>
	<br>	He's in connecticut with his mom.
	<br>
	<br>	He said he would try to catch a train
	<br>
	<br>	And make it to the party tonight. yeah, well, an eleanor Waldorf soiree--
	<br>
	<br>	Another new york institution that I miss.
	<br>
	<br>	You know, you don't have to miss any of it.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, well, I wish that I could be in two places at once,
	<br>
	<br>	My dear, but impossible. sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	You know that chateau near lyon that I told you about?
	<br>
	<br>	Mm-hmm. roman and I bought it.
	<br>
	<br>	You bought that place? yes.
	<br>
	<br>	And with roman?
	<br>
	<br>	The house is flooded with light.
	<br>
	<br>	The fireplaces are big enough. I mean, you can walk into them.
	<br>
	<br>	The gardens are incroyable.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, pardon me. I'm taking my niece skating,
	<br>
	<br>	And I can't seem to locate the rink.
	<br>
	<br>	But it's-- it's right over there.
	<br>
	<br>	Of course. the throng of children in mittens
	<br>
	<br>	Should have tipped me off. thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	You're welcome.
	<br>
	<br>	The handsome man was just flirting with you.
	<br>
	<br>	That's absurd. he was not flirting with me.
	<br>
	<br>	roman, it is going to be so dull for you To sit and watch them skate.
	<br>
	<br>	yes. why don't you go to the petting zoo
	<br>
	<br>	And feed the sheep?
	<br>
	<br>	Or why don't I join you on the rink? it looks fun.
	<br>
	<br>	Wonderful.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes. super.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll get you skates. see you there.
	<br>
	<br>	Super.
	<br>
	<br>	You're not autographing those
	<br>
	<br>	And selling them on ebay, are you? no. no, no.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm just checking out some of the previous publishees,
	<br>
	<br>	And I'm--i'm in great company here. it's the new yorker."
	<br>
	<br>	V., how can I top this? I can't, really,
	<br>
	<br>	Unless I rig the oscars for one of your documentaries.
	<br>
	<br>	You got in on your own merit.
	<br>
	<br>	The only gift I gave you was to lick a stamp, and as for me,
	<br>
	<br>	The annual Dan Humphrey christmas cd mix
	<br>
	<br>	Is more than enough. all right, yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	What's in the bag?
	<br>
	<br>	Perfection.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, I know it's not christmas yet, but open it, please.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't wait. I'm too excited.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, my.
	<br>
	<br>	I noticed the other day that you don't wear a watch,
	<br>
	<br>	And then it occurred to me it's because you don't have a watch,
	<br>
	<br>	And you're gonna need one to be punctual for all the meetings
	<br>
	<br>	With editors and publishers now that you're a fancy
	<br>
	<br>	And apparently, self-important writer.
	<br>
	<br>	You don't like it. you want the brown band.
	<br>
	<br>	No, no, no. I love the band. I love the whole thing.
	<br>
	<br>	It's--it's the most amazing watch I've ever seen,
	<br>
	<br>	But I can't accept this.
	<br>
	<br>	What? oh, yes, you can.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, it's more of a gift for me
	<br>
	<br>	Because I had so much fun picking it out for you.
	<br>
	<br>	You have to.
	<br>
	<br>	Serena, I buy a book for my dad every christmas.
	<br>
	<br>	I think the most elaborate gift I've ever given
	<br>
	<br>	Has been a pair of rubber boots from l.l. bean.
	<br>
	<br>	So then I overdid it?
	<br>
	<br>	I think even your underdoing it
	<br>
	<br>	Would be overdoing it.
	<br>
	<br>	Look, um, let's--let's-- let's set some rules,
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe some helpful guidelines.
	<br>
	<br>	Fine.
	<br>
	<br>	Deadline?
	<br>
	<br>	Um, tomorrow morning.
	<br>
	<br>	Price limit?
	<br>
	<br>	50 bucks.
	<br>
	<br>	All right. may the best gift win.
	<br>
	<br>	If it's any help, I can tell you Dan's favorite used book shop.
	<br>
	<br>	That's okay. I think I got it.
	<br>
	<br>	Are you Alex? who are you?
	<br>
	<br>	Rufus humphrey.
	<br>
	<br>	Unless you want to be carried out of here,
	<br>
	<br>	You're gonna stay the hell away from my wife.
	<br>
	<br>	Calm down now.
	<br>
	<br>	You sent a letter to my wife
	<br>
	<br>	At my house where my children live?
	<br>
	<br>	Whatever you had with her is over.
	<br>
	<br>	Why don't you sit down? she told you to leave her alone.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	That's not what she told me a couple days ago.
	<br>
	<br>	Excuse me. you...
	<br>
	<br>	You spoke to her?
	<br>
	<br>	Damn it. you can do it. you can do it.
	<br>
	<br>	Look at all these children.
	<br>
	<br>	They're skating around fearlessly. come on.
	<br>
	<br>	They got a lot shorter way to fall. Blair, will you help us here?
	<br>
	<br>	We need you!
	<br>
	<br>	Just a second. my laces came undone.
	<br>
	<br>	Now here we go.
	<br>
	<br>	Ready? now go to Blair. okay.
	<br>
	<br>	You can do it! Blair!
	<br>
	<br>	Come give us a lesson.
	<br>
	<br>	Spotted spinning at Wollman rink--
	<br>
	<br>	The Blair capades. all the grace of nancy kerrigan,
	<br>
	<br>	But packing the punch of tonya harding.
	<br>
	<br>	Pauvre roman.
	<br>
	<br>	va?
	<br>
	<br>	Are you all right?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm so clumsy. my foot got caught behind the skate.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh. here. let me help you.
	<br>
	<br>	I cannot believe that daddy decided to stay with roman
	<br>
	<br>	Instead of having tea at the carlyle with me.
	<br>
	<br>	The e.r. doctor said he would make a full recovery.
	<br>
	<br>	Everything is ruined.
	<br>
	<br>	Why wod you say that? you and I had a marvelous time.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, I'm sorry, mother. it's just not the same.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't understand how that french fox stole my father
	<br>
	<br>	And your husband
	<br>
	<br>	And always seems to come off like a-an innocent lamb.
	<br>
	<br>	roman was not always so innocent, you know.
	<br>
	<br>	Really? what's his story?
	<br>
	<br>	Mm, well, when I first met him,
	<br>
	<br>	He was going out with this model named Freddy,
	<br>
	<br>	And Freddy was a horrible scoundrel.
	<br>
	<br>	roman would actually be into somebody like that?
	<br>
	<br>	Into him? he was--he was absolutely infatuated with him.
	<br>
	<br>	Freddy had him under some kind of spell.
	<br>
	<br>	I was the one who got him to break out of it
	<br>
	<br>	And turn his life around. don't mention Freddy to your father.
	<br>
	<br>	It is a sore subject. okay. what was Freddy's last name?
	<br>
	<br>	Hey. where were you?
	<br>
	<br>	I tried to call you, but your phone was off.
	<br>
	<br>	I kept your date for you with Alex.
	<br>
	<br>	He's actually a pretty cool guy
	<br>
	<br>	Other than the fact that he's in love with my wife.
	<br>
	<br>	He told me about your phone call.
	<br>
	<br>	He... felt that I owed him an explanation,
	<br>
	<br>	And he was right.
	<br>
	<br>	And you didn't tell me that because...
	<br>
	<br>	Because there was nothing to tell.
	<br>
	<br>	I told Alex that I was back with my family
	<br>
	<br>	And to stop calling.
	<br>
	<br>	Would you have come back...
	<br>
	<br>	If jenny hadn't shown up to bring you?
	<br>
	<br>	If I hadn't, would Lily be here right now?
	<br>
	<br>	I guess by turning our backs on these other people,
	<br>
	<br>	We thought we could fix ourselves.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe other people aren't the problem.
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe we changed.
	<br>
	<br>	And at what point do we admit
	<br>
	<br>	That no matter how much we want it or how hard we try...
	<br>
	<br>	It'sujt t not rking.
	<br>
	<br>	I know it's been maybe ten minutes since I last asked,
	<br>
	<br>	But are you still sure you don't want to talk about it?
	<br>
	<br>	Dad said he didn't want to ruin christmas.
	<br>
	<br>	That's what I'm trying to do. hey, well,
	<br>
	<br>	Just in case you change your mind...
	<br>
	<br>	You're here. I know.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay. how about this?
	<br>
	<br>	At least you know it's something Serena doesn't have.
	<br>
	<br>	A year of cheese for $600? are these people kidding?
	<br>
	<br>	I could buy a cow for that much money and make my own cheese.
	<br>
	<br>	You just said "make my own cheese." that's disgusting.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm never goaa findndhis gift for Serena. yeah,
	<br>
	<br>	And your gift needs to be especially good this year
	<br>
	<br>	To make up for the rest of her christmas. what do you mean?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, she's living in a hotel. you know, how homey can it be?
	<br>
	<br>	It's not exactly festive.
	<br>
	<br>	Eric told me they don't even allow trees.
	<br>
	<br>	Leave a message, and I might listen.
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck, you are not answering my calls,
	<br>
	<br>	To torture me, I am sure, but please, for the love of god,
	<br>
	<br>	Do not tell anybody about us, okay?
	<br>
	<br>	Please? please.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey. you told me to come right away.
	<br>
	<br>	Is everything all right? yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	Why aren't you with your dad? uh,
	<br>
	<br>	I need your log-in for your agency's site
	<br>
	<br>	From your modeling days. my modeling days?
	<br>
	<br>	I did one print ad for gap when I was 12.
	<br>
	<br>	What, are you holding an open call or something?
	<br>
	<br>	I have one specific look in mind.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, okay, well I don't know
	<br>
	<br>	If it'll still even be in here, but...
	<br>
	<br>	Well, look at that.
	<br>
	<br>	Addresses and phone numbers. perfect.
	<br>
	<br>	You know, I called you an hour ago. b.t.w., you're late.
	<br>
	<br>	Um, you're lucky I'm even here at all.
	<br>
	<br>	It's christmas eve, and I still haven't found a gift for Dan.
	<br>
	<br>	Now all the stores are closing, and I'm totally screwed.
	<br>
	<br>	Do you have any idea what you can buy
	<br>
	<br>	For under $50 these days? I don't know.
	<br>
	<br>	A single entry at a mid-priced restaurant?
	<br>
	<br>	Three-quarters of a dvd box set?
	<br>
	<br>	Maybe a pair of Wolford stockings.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, stockings. yes, great idea for dan.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair, please, this is serious.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know. why don't you buy him a gold money clip
	<br>
	<br>	From cartier, say it's $49.99? he won't know the difference.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing anyway?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm booking me a model.
	<br>
	<br>	I come to you hat in hand, tail betwe m my le
	<br>
	<br>	And off my high horse.
	<br>
	<br>	I spent the entire day searching for the perfect gift for Dan.
	<br>
	<br>	Now all the stores are closing, christmas day is looming,
	<br>
	<br>	And, um... I need your help.
	<br>
	<br>	I could take this opportunity to gloat,
	<br>
	<br>	But I actually like you.
	<br>
	<br>	So let's get down to business. what do you have so far?
	<br>
	<br>	Um, I found a first edition j.l. hall book,
	<br>
	<br>	Original italian poster of the "400 blows"
	<br>
	<br>	And a montblanc fountain pen. all very thoughtful.
	<br>
	<br>	And all exceed $50.
	<br>
	<br>	Right.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, Dan's not really that into things.
	<br>
	<br>	Which makes shopping for him kind of hopeless.
	<br>
	<br>	The only thing he wants for christmas is snow.
	<br>
	<br>	It's not like I can give him that.
	<br>
	<br>	You sure?
	<br>
	<br>	Happy holidays.
	<br>
	<br>	Welcome. welcome.
	<br>
	<br>	We're doing things a little untraditionally this year.
	<br>
	<br>	I don't know if you've heard.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm desiining a ne of lingerie for victoria's secret.
	<br>
	<br>	I walked into the store, and I fell in love with this tree.
	<br>
	<br>	Isn't that lipstick clever? isn't it?
	<br>
	<br>	Good. have some eggnog.
	<br>
	<br>	Hello? hey. it's me.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey. so, uh, running into each other at the school fair--
	<br>
	<br>	Kind of awkward.
	<br>
	<br>	I suppose so, especially after our last phone call.
	<br>
	<br>	Rufus, we really shouldn't be speaking.
	<br>
	<br>	No, I know.
	<br>
	<br>	But if there's something you want to say,
	<br>
	<br>	You should go ahead and say it
	<br>
	<br>	Is there something you want me to say?
	<br>
	<br>	Rufus...
	<br>
	<br>	Why are you calling?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, i...
	<br>
	<br>	Just wanted to say merry christmas.
	<br>
	<br>	Hope you have a good holiday.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, well...
	<br>
	<br>	I'm, um, flying to Anguilla with Bart tonight,
	<br>
	<br>	So I'm expecting it to be a-a great holiday--
	<br>
	<br>	One for the ages, in fact.
	<br>
	<br>	Good night, Rufus. good-bye.
	<br>
	<br>	Anguilla.
	<br>
	<br>	What is the matter with me?
	<br>
	<br>	I don't think so. oh.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh. excuse me.
	<br>
	<br>	What are you doing here? well, I was hoping to see you again.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought it great good fortune that roman tracked me down
	<br>
	<br>	At the skating rink and extended an invitation.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, well...
	<br>
	<br>	En--enjoy the party.
	<br>
	<br>	How dare you invite a strange man into my home.
	<br>
	<br>	Jack came?
	<br>
	<br>	Go talk to him.
	<br>
	<br>	Bring vodka. roman...
	<br>
	<br>	You practically picked him up off the street.
	<br>
	<br>	And then I googled him. his name is Jack Roth.
	<br>
	<br>	He owns a prominent hedge fund
	<br>
	<br>	With offices in london and barcelona,
	<br>
	<br>	And he finds you very attractive.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, that's no excuse,
	<br>
	<br>	And--and--and I am doing just fine
	<br>
	<br>	Without your romantic help.
	<br>
	<br>	Are you?
	<br>
	<br>	Eleanor, we've been friends for a long time....
	<br>
	<br>	Since before Marc Jacobs went into rehab.
	<br>
	<br>	Friends don't steal other friends' husbands.
	<br>
	<br>	Is Nate there?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh. a few hours ago?
	<br>
	<br>	Chuck bass didn't call for him, did he?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, never mind. did Nate say where he was going?
	<br>
	<br>	No, no. don't--don disturbrb mrs. Archibald.
	<br>
	<br>	Um, I'm sure he's on his way here now.
	<br>
	<br>	All right. thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Dorota's gonna kill you if you get glue on that comforter.
	<br>
	<br>	Sorry we've turned your room into an art studio, b.,
	<br>
	<br>	But the clock is ticking.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm done.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, my gosh.
	<br>
	<br>	Wow. that--that's amazing.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you so much, Vanessa. this is gonna be... incredible.
	<br>
	<br>	Good. I'm glad I could help.
	<br>
	<br>	I think he'll really love it.
	<br>
	<br>	Vanessa?
	<br>
	<br>	I think I'd like to help with this little project.
	<br>
	<br>	Would you come and help me find another pair of scissors?
	<br>
	<br>	It's so nice what you're doing for your friend Dan,
	<br>
	<br>	Helping his girlfriend make his christmas present.
	<br>
	<br>	Serena is so grateful
	<br>
	<br>	Because she likes to see the best in people.
	<br>
	<br>	I like to see the truth.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah? and what's that?
	<br>
	<br>	I think you like Dan a little too much.
	<br>
	<br>	Just thought I should let you know
	<br>
	<br>	Someone's watching.
	<br>
	<br>	Merry christmas.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm taking off. call me when you're done?
	<br>
	<br>	Okay. where you going?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm gonna go check on my daddy. I thought you were gonna help.
	<br>
	<br>	I think my work's done here. oh, hello.
	<br>
	<br>	Hi. good-bye. when you two are done hiding up here,
	<br>
	<br>	I'm taking you both out for dessert. can't, mom. I'm busy.
	<br>
	<br>	But this is important for our family.
	<br>
	<br>	It'll just be the three of us. mom,
	<br>
	<br>	Anytime you say it'll just be the three of us,
	<br>
	<br>	It means you're dating someone new. whoever it is,
	<br>
	<br>	I don't care. I'll just meet him at the wedding. fine, fine.
	<br>
	<br>	Then I will just tell you who it is,
	<br>
	<br>	Because you're gonna be seeing him around from now on.
	<br>
	<br>	It's Bart Bass. Bart Bass?
	<br>
	<br>	Mom, you cannot date Bart Bass.
	<br>
	<br>	You just said a moment ago you didn't care who it was.
	<br>
	<br>	That was before I knew who it was.
	<br>
	<br>	He only has one facial expression. he scares me.
	<br>
	<br>	And he raised Chuck. that scares me.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, Serena, as usual, you're being overly dramatic.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm not marrying Bart.
	<br>
	<br>	This is very casual,
	<br>
	<br>	And regardless, I'm not asking your permission.
	<br>
	<br>	You know when I suggested this plan,
	<br>
	<br>	I didn't know that it would entail a robbery. hey, hey, hey.
	<br>
	<br>	I left a donation.
	<br>
	<br>	So it was more of a rescue than a robbery.
	<br>
	<br>	You know, those abandoned trees in that lot
	<br>
	<br>	Were just gonna be kindling the day after christmas,
	<br>
	<br>	And this tree that we have here is gonna be loved and admired.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, yeah, you have a real talent for spin, my brother. okay.
	<br>
	<br>	I wish I had more talent for heavy lifting. oh.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh. yeah, well, what you're doing for Serena is really romantic.
	<br>
	<br>	I wonder what mom and dad
	<br>
	<br>	Are gettineach other for christmas.
	<br>
	<br>	I thought that if I got them under the same roof
	<br>
	<br>	That things would go back to the way they were.
	<br>
	<br>	They haven't, have they?
	<br>
	<br>	I think there's a real possibility
	<br>
	<br>	That they might split up.
	<br>
	<br>	If I hadn't brought her back, though,
	<br>
	<br>	We could've just kept pretending
	<br>
	<br>	That she's just in Hudson doing her art.
	<br>
	<br>	You did the right thing, Jen.
	<br>
	<br>	Really, you did, cause whatever happens now,
	<br>
	<br>	At least, uh, we're not living in a fantasy, you know?
	<br>
	<br>	Wonderful party, Eleanor.
	<br>
	<br>	So you... ice-skate?
	<br>
	<br>	Occasionally, with my niece,
	<br>
	<br>	But she's much more talented than I am.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, I haven't skated since ages,
	<br>
	<br>	But I used to love it when I was a girl.
	<br>
	<br>	You must have been very beautiful out there on the ice.
	<br>
	<br>	Excuse me.
	<br>
	<br>	Merry christmas. merry christmas.
	<br>
	<br>	Excuse me.
	<br>
	<br>	Freddy, what on earth are you doing here? oh, roman invited me.
	<br>
	<br>	What?
	<br>
	<br>	Freddy, what... what are you doing here?
	<br>
	<br>	He said that you invited him. what?
	<br>
	<br>	Freddy.
	<br>
	<br>	roman, explain this.
	<br>
	<br>	I can't.
	<br>
	<br>	And so true. how does one explain the indescribable pull
	<br>
	<br>	To see an old lover, to feel that jolt of electricity?
	<br>
	<br>	So you couldn't last two days in town without contacting him?
	<br>
	<br>	I can't believe you'd trust appearances and not me.
	<br>
	<br>	Harold, dear, i-- roman did not invite Freddy.
	<br>
	<br>	I think Blair did.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair?
	<br>
	<br>	Freddy...
	<br>
	<br>	If you want to be the featured model in my spring catalog,
	<br>
	<br>	You'd better tell us the truth.
	<br>
	<br>	She might have offered to buy me a cruise...
	<br>
	<br>	And renew my gym membership.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, you might as well take that cruise,
	<br>
	<br>	Because you'll be featured in my catalog
	<br>
	<br>	When hell freezes over.
	<br>
	<br>	Now please, get out. thanks for the champagne.
	<br>
	<br>	Merry christmas.
	<br>
	<br>	Looks like daddy's little girl
	<br>
	<br>	Isn't sugar and spice and everything nice after all.
	<br>
	<br>	I wish you would just slow down for a second
	<br>
	<br>	And let her be. well, I just can't believe
	<br>
	<br>	That Blair would do something so cruel,
	<br>
	<br>	And roman, who's only ever been completely kind to her.
	<br>
	<br>	It isn't roman Blair's lashing out at--it's you.
	<br>
	<br>	She was so looking forward to spending time with you alone,
	<br>
	<br>	And then you show up at our doorstep with your lover,
	<br>
	<br>	Without a word of warning. how did you expect her to react?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, I hoped that once we were together,
	<br>
	<br>	It would all work out.
	<br>
	<br>	I suppose that was pretty naive.
	<br>
	<br>	Blair learned scheming from her mother
	<br>
	<br>	And unrealistic dreaming from her father.
	<br>
	<br>	She tries really hard to act all grown-up,
	<br>
	<br>	But don't you be fooled.
	<br>
	<br>	She's still a little girl who needs her daddy.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay, stop, stop, stop. ow.
	<br>
	<br>	Okay. what now?
	<br>
	<br>	Now you go in there,
	<br>
	<br>	You distract dexter, the humorless concierge... okay.
	<br>
	<br>	While I try and sneak this into an elevator. all right, um,
	<br>
	<br>	Who's gonna turn you into hercules
	<br>
	<br>	So you can carry this thing by yourself?
	<br>
	<br>	I did--i did not say the pl was foolproof.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, ms. Van Der Woods-- Lily, hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Dan. Jenny. tree. hi.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah, um, they don't allow christmas trees inside,
	<br>
	<br>	Which is why we're out here.
	<br>
	<br>	Which is why Dan's about to ask you for a favor.
	<br>
	<br>	Ah, does it involve distracting dexter
	<br>
	<br>	And sneaking into the elevator? why? would that work?
	<br>
	<br>	No. never. he has the eyes of a hawk,
	<br>
	<br>	And he takes his job very seriously.
	<br>
	<br>	So I've noticed.
	<br>
	<br>	But Bobby at the service entrance--
	<br>
	<br>	I think he could be bought.
	<br>
	<br>	Come.
	<br>
	<br>	I just sent him a text, and dan's on his way.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you so much. it's really no problem,
	<br>
	<br>	And since there are no problems, I should go.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, no, no, no. stay, please.
	<br>
	<br>	You don't need me. we talked about how to turn everything on.
	<br>
	<br>	No, I know I can do it, but I just want you to see Dan's face.
	<br>
	<br>	I've really gotta get going. okay. well, I'll tell him how much you did.
	<br>
	<br>	Please don't. it's your present.
	<br>
	<br>	Just... enjoy your night.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, this is Nate. I can't come to the ph--
	<br>
	<br>	Can I come in?
	<br>
	<br>	Our flight leaves in a few hours.
	<br>
	<br>	I wanted to say good-bye.
	<br>
	<br>	Please forgive me, Blair.
	<br>
	<br>	I should have told you that I was bringing roman.
	<br>
	<br>	I knew that having him here would be hard for you,
	<br>
	<br>	But I love you so much, and I love roman,
	<br>
	<br>	And I was hoping that if we were all thrown together,
	<br>
	<br>	That something... perfect would happen
	<br>
	<br>	And that you would love him, too.
	<br>
	<br>	I was gonna convince you to move back to new york,
	<br>
	<br>	But you bought a vineyard
	<br>
	<br>	In france with roman.
	<br>
	<br>	What's next, a commitment ceremony?
	<br>
	<br>	Great.
	<br>
	<br>	There's no room in your life for me anymore.
	<br>
	<br>	Sweetheart, there is always room for you.
	<br>
	<br>	No matter where I am, no matter who I'm with.
	<br>
	<br>	I, uh...
	<br>
	<br>	This is part of your christmas gift.
	<br>
	<br>	Yourouse in france.
	<br>
	<br>	It's very nice, daddy.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sure you and roman will totally enjoy it.
	<br>
	<br>	And so will you,
	<br>
	<br>	Because this...
	<br>
	<br>	Is your room.
	<br>
	<br>	It's beautiful.
	<br>
	<br>	We're having it decorated just for you.
	<br>
	<br>	A cat.
	<br>
	<br>	A cat named "cat,"
	<br>
	<br>	like in your favorite movie.
	<br>
	<br>	It was roman's idea.
	<br>
	<br>	So... merry christmas, sweetheart.
	<br>
	<br>	We're hoping that you'll spend the whole summer with us.
	<br>
	<br>	Merry christmas.
	<br>
	<br>	Do you like it? do you think it's cheesy?
	<br>
	<br>	No.
	<br>
	<br>	No, no, it's--it's incredible.
	<br>
	<br>	How did you do this?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, I had help from my elves.
	<br>
	<br>	Your present is waiting for you at home,
	<br>
	<br>	But, um, I did bring a little pre-present for you.
	<br>
	<br>	Wait. this is your story. yeah, it's the original.
	<br>
	<br>	It's right out of the spiral notebook.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm kinda scared to read it.
	<br>
	<br>	What happened on october 8th, 2005?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, I was accidentally invited
	<br>
	<br>	To a birthday party where I met a girl.
	<br>
	<br>	She only spoke two sentences to me,
	<br>
	<br>	But I've never forgotten her.
	<br>
	<br>	Wait. your story's about me?
	<br>
	<br>	Are we really gonna do this?
	<br>
	<br>	The arts and crafts were impressive,
	<br>
	<br>	But how did you manage the real snow?
	<br>
	<br>	I'm well-connected.
	<br>
	<br>	This is, without question, the best christmas ever.
	<br>
	<br>	Ever in the history of christmas.
	<br>
	<br>	I hate to break the spell,
	<br>
	<br>	But, uh, we better get home before our families wake up.
	<br>
	<br>	Eleanor... hmm?
	<br>
	<br>	You are a marvel.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, stop it. mmm.
	<br>
	<br>	Who knew there were men like you
	<br>
	<br>	Wandering around central park, lost?
	<br>
	<br>	Eleanor, good morning,
	<br>
	<br>	And, Jack, nice to see you. good morning.
	<br>
	<br>	Yes, wonderful.
	<br>
	<br>	The flights were all canceled because of the weather.
	<br>
	<br>	I wanted to tell Blair in person.
	<br>
	<br>	Do not worry. we--we have a room at the pierre.
	<br>
	<br>	No, it's nonsense. you--you'll stay with us.
	<br>
	<br>	Thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	You'll call me later?
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, yes.
	<br>
	<br>	I'll be spending christmas with my... family.
	<br>
	<br>	Bye.
	<br>
	<br>	What's going on?
	<br>
	<br>	We're back for christmas.
	<br>
	<br>	Well, roman, you are in for a treat,
	<br>
	<br>	Because a Waldorf christmas is like no other.
	<br>
	<br>	Come on, you.
	<br>
	<br>	Whew. merry christmas, dad. you're up early.
	<br>
	<br>	And you're getting in awfully late. oh, yeah, well, I left you a message.
	<br>
	<br>	Saying the tree shenanigans were taking all night,
	<br>
	<br>	But I didn't think you meant literally all night.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh. yeah, , yeah, the tree. it was a big production.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, luckily Serena's mom was there to help with the plan.
	<br>
	<br>	Lily was there?
	<br>
	<br>	I thought you mentioned she was out of the country. no. no, they're here.
	<br>
	<br>	They're gonna go see "the nutcracker" tomorrow.
	<br>
	<br>	Do I smell chocolate chip waffles?
	<br>
	<br>	With hot caramel sauce. your father's christmas specialty.
	<br>
	<br>	Dan, pass the chocolate chips. good morning.
	<br>
	<br>	Good morning. after breakfast and presents,
	<br>
	<br>	I need to go to the gallery... mm.
	<br>
	<br>	To take care of some stuff. on christmas morning?
	<br>
	<br>	Well, yeah, you know, art never sleeps.
	<br>
	<br>	Buy u u ow what? the three of us could hang out together.
	<br>
	<br>	It'll be great. we'll drink hot cocoa and watch a movie,
	<br>
	<br>	And then when your dad comes back, we can all go for a walk.
	<br>
	<br>	Hear those silver bells? it's christmastime in the city.
	<br>
	<br>	Some families actually do make the yuletide gay,
	<br>
	<br>	Managing to leave their troubles far away...
	<br>
	<br>	Mom. oh, it's beautiful. thank you. thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, look. you look like a brunette catherine deneuve.
	<br>
	<br>	Quelle magnifique. it's so gorgeous.
	<br>
	<br>	Merry christmas, Dorota. it's so we can text.
	<br>
	<br>	Do you like it? thank you, miss Blair.
	<br>
	<br>	Other families have a merry little christmas
	<br>
	<br>	Even when their troubles aren't so far away...
	<br>
	<br>	So what did dad have to do at the gallery, exactly?
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, paperwork, i-i think.
	<br>
	<br>	You're going back to Hudson, aren't you?
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah.
	<br>
	<br>	But, hey, we are gonna be okay.
	<br>
	<br>	Come here.
	<br>
	<br>	We know.
	<br>
	<br>	I'm sorry.
	<br>
	<br>	Some presents might end up getting returned...
	<br>
	<br>	I know how you like florida.
	<br>
	<br>	Yeah. wow.
	<br>
	<br>	Uh, number one fan.
	<br>
	<br>	You know, I'm--i'm sorry I didn't get anything for you,
	<br>
	<br>	Mr. Bass, but, uh, I didn't know you'd be coming for christmas.
	<br>
	<br>	Ah, no worries, Eric. please, call me Bart.
	<br>
	<br>	But some gifts are for keeps.
	<br>
	<br>	For you. thank you.
	<br>
	<br>	Eric, Serena,
	<br>
	<br>	I just want you to know
	<br>
	<br>	That I have deep feelings for your mother.
	<br>
	<br>	mom, your phone.
	<br>
	<br>	Oh. uh, Lily, you're not gonna want to interrupt this moment.
	<br>
	<br>	Other presents come when you least expect em.
	<br>
	<br>	Hey, Lil. you know everything's closed on christmas?
	<br>
	<br>	Diners that claim to be open 24/7--
	<br>
	<br>	It's false advertising.
	<br>
	<br>	And everyone knows
	<br>
	<br>	The biggest present comes in the smallest box.
	<br>
	<br>	So, uh, Alison's leaving.
	<br>
	<br>	She's spending time alone with the kids.
	<br>
	<br>	And I seem to have walked all the way from brooklyn
	<br>
	<br>	To your doorstep
	<br>
	<br>	Without a jacket, in the snow.
	<br>
	<br>	So what the hell?
	<br>
	<br>	I miss you...
	<br>
	<br>	And I have been missing you for a while.
	<br>
	<br>	Lily...
	<br>
	<br>	Would you do me the honor of being my wife?
	<br>
	<br>	Fromage! cheese!
	<br>
	<br>	Ah, perfect.
	<br>
	<br>	Then there are those boxes
	<br>
	<br>	You wish you had never opened...
	<br>
	<br>	Oh, I like the pa--
	<br>
	<br>	Have a holly jolly christmas.
