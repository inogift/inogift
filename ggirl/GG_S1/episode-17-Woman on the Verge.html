	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Rufus	:	</strong>	 Yeah, but a lot of people remember. There's a reason that issue was one of the highest selling of the year.	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Dan	:	</strong>	 And I'm proud, Dad, I really am. You got your follow-up article and a concert, surely followed by an overpriced CD sold at corporate coffeehouses for Gen Xers without taste buds or taste.	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Rufus	:	</strong>	 Hey, it's gonna be cool. I mean, they're even filming it for vh1.	</p>

	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Rufus	:	</strong>	 I'm classic! Uh-oh, no retort. Signs of a sleepless night. Disinterest in making your father feel old and irrelevant... That can only mean one thing. Girl trouble.	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Dan	:	</strong>	 Yeah, Serena and I, we had a fight last night. This new kind we keep having where she says something, and I know it's not the whole truth.	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Rufus	:	</strong>	 Well, have you asked her what's really on her mind?	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Dan	:	</strong>	 Only about ten thousand times, yeah.	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Rufus	:	</strong>	 Yeah, but did you really mean it? Most times, when people don't offer the truth, it's because they're afraid of what someone might think. And I don't know if you know this, but you can be a pretty judgmental guy.	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Dan	:	</strong>	 So you're saying that I should learn to be someone else around her so she can be herself around me?	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Rufus	:	</strong>	 Couldn't have said it better myself.	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>

	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Vanessa	:	</strong>	 I switched shifts and just got off. I'm Dan's Dad's roadie for the day, so I gotta bail in like five. Um, although I don't mind the stalking... When are you gonna ask me on a real date?	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Nate, answering his phone	:	</strong>	 Uh... Hold that thought. Sorry. Hello? Yeah. Yeah, okay, I'll be right there. Look, I'm sorry. I gotta go...	</p>

	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Lily	:	</strong>	 Sweetie... If I've learned anything in life, it is that sometimes things get in your path, and you have a choice. You can either smash right into them, or you can adjust and move around, but you have to do one or the other in order to move forward.	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>

	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Lily	:	</strong>	 Oh, you heard what they said. Look, Peter was an addict for ten years. His own parents couldn't get him to stop using, there's no way that a sixteen-year-old girl could have. They don't hold you responsible. You don't need to blame yourself...	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Serena	:	</strong>	 -- But I am responsible, Mom. I'm the one that gave him the line that killed him.	</p>

	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Georgina	:	</strong>	 Because... My boyfriend -- well, my ex-boyfriend -- when we broke up, he wasn't too happy about it, and things got out of control.	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Dan	:	</strong>	 Okay, well, what happened?	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Georgina	:	</strong>	 I came home one day, and... My car was broken into, and then a week later, my room was trashed, and I got really scared. I changed all my numbers, I moved in with a friend, and yet he still tracked me down. It was my Mom's idea to change my name and move out of town. I hate being away from my family, but... It's better than getting hurt, right?	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Dan	:	</strong>	 Yeah, right.	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>

	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Georgina	:	</strong>	 And I also didn't want you to think less of me, because I haven't wanted to admit it, but, um... From the moment that I met you, I've been falling for you. Oh my God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't... I don't know what I'm saying...	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Dan, over the cheers for Lisa Loeb	:	</strong>	 You know, um, you know, it's really loud here. Do you wanna go somewhere else, someplace quiet we can talk?	</p>
	<p class="full-script">						</p>
	<p class="full-script">	<strong>	Georgina	:	</strong>	 But your Dad's about to go on...	</p>
