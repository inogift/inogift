<p>You Agent Tork?</p>
<p>Yeah. You guys done looking around in there?</p>
<p>'Cause we're just sitting on our hands out here.</p>
<p>There's nothing we could find.</p>
<p>It's a mess in there. But the structure's sound. Your people can go in. Have fun.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>All right, listen up.</p>
<p>It's been reported there are two bodies in the basement of this house.</p>
<p>There may also be evidence pertaining to as many as 10 homicides committed by the recently deceased individual known as Lazarus, real name Joseph Keller.</p>
<p>We want to put these cases to bed, so that means break out the fine-toothed combs.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>[ Exhales sharply ]</p>
<p>How's your head?</p>
<p>Oh, hey.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>It's fine.</p>
<p>Ears are still ringing a little, but, uh, just getting ready for the remodel.</p>
<p>I brought sandwiches.</p>
<p>Those are the magic words.</p>
<p>Come with me.</p>
<p>[ Insects chirping ]</p>
<p>Is it me, or does it seem like the house slants a little bit to the left?</p>
<p>Optical illusion.</p>
<p>You're not wearing your wedding ring.</p>
<p>I'm not married.</p>
<p>The ground is slanty, so it makes the structure look like it's leaning, but it is, in fact, not.</p>
<p>It's just an optical illusion.</p>
<p>Slanty, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah. Technical term.</p>
<p>This ring has been with me for a very long time, and, uh... it has obvious significance with my past.</p>
<p>It also represents... meeting you.</p>
<p>If I didn't have this ring, I would never have met you.</p>
<p>So in a sense, uh... It has the potential to represent my future, as well.</p>
<p>And I-I'm not expecting you would ever wear it, but I want to share it with you, and... I want it to represent our future...together.</p>
<p>I want you to be my wife.</p>
<p>Will you marry me?</p>
<p>Okay. [ Laughs ]</p>
<p>Yes, yes. [ Laughs ]</p>
<p>Yes? Excellent.</p>
<p>[ Laughs ]</p>
<p>I'm glad that's dealt with. I was a little nervous.</p>
<p>Oh, come on. You knew I was gonna say yes.</p>
<p>No, even after all these years, you're still a mystery to me.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ] Thank you.</p>
<p>Hey, guys, how's the Lazarus case going?</p>
<p>Keller's house is being processed right now.</p>
<p>Tork's on the scene.</p>
<p>We're just squaring away the paperwork.</p>
<p>Oh, good. Good, good, good.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Do you guys need anything? Can I help?</p>
<p>Mm...No, not really.</p>

<p>Eh, well, you snooze, you lose.</p>
<p>We're gonna miss him at the bachelor party, though.</p>
<p>There is no bachelor party.</p>
<p>We're getting married the day after tomorrow, just me and Jane and the Justice of the Peace.</p>

<p>Uh...Oh.</p>

<p>Yeah, family.</p>
<p>[ Chuckling ] Yeah.</p>
<p>No, it's just us. We want to get married quietly.</p>

<p>But we're gonna be there, T. I mean, no argument.</p>
<p>Hey, Stan, hold it. It's her deal, her choice.</p>

<p><em>If we're not there, mom's gonna spin in her grave like a freaking crankshaft. Oh, my God.</p>

<p>Teresa just said she don't us there.</p>
<p>Why would you want to be there if she doesn't want us there? I mean --</p>
<p>You're a sad, bitter man, Jimmy Lisbon.</p>
<p>Well, I-I smile through it. don't you ever --</p>
<p>I smile through the sadness.</p>
<p>Stop it. He's doing it again.</p>
<p>I got stronger, though. Ever since he was a little kid --</p>
<p>Ohh! It's just -- it cuts to the airflow!</p>
<p>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>Don't worry about what?</p>
<p>You're worried that I'm gonna be upset because you invited your brothers to our marriage.</p>
<p>How did you know that?</p>
<p>When we're married, do you think you might stop asking that question?</p>
<p>It's okay, isn't it? They're family.</p>
<p>Thank you. It means a lot to them.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>[ Sighs ] Since my brothers are coming, it feels... funny not to invite just a couple of members from the team.</p>
<p>No, no. You know what? You're right. We should keep it small -- small. Just my brothers.</p>
<p>Eh, fine. Invite away.</p>
<p>We're gonna need a few more guests just to dilute the alcohol content.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Just three or four, though.</p>
<p>Where do we draw the line?</p>
<p>Well, that's why we decided not to invite anyone.</p>
<p>I know. I know.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>It's just -- here we are.</p>
<p>[ Laughs ] Here we are.</p>
<p>What? [ Laughing ]</p>
<p>Oh, look, I'm just gonna surrender to fate, all right?</p>
<p>So be it.</p>
<p>Big, huge, massive wedding.</p>
<p>No, just 8 or 9 very close friends at the courthouse -- 9 or 10, and then we can go to O'Malley's bar afterwards.</p>
<p>12 tops.</p>
<p>Or we could go to a restaurant. No big deal.</p>
<p>It's not like we're hiring a caterer.</p>
<p>We don't have a gift registry or anything.</p>
<p>Sure. Okay.</p>
<p>Where are you going?</p>
<p>Well, I have to get you a ring.</p>
<p>I already have one.</p>
<p>That is for<em> us.</em></p>
<p>You need one for<em> you.</em></p>
<p>I do?</p>
<p>You do.</p>
<p>All right, well, shouldn't I come with you?</p>
<p>Isn't that how you're supposed to do it?</p>
<p>No, I think we'll waste time bickering.</p>
<p>Besides, I have better taste.</p>
<p>You<em> think</em> you do.</p>
<p>You'll see.</p>
<p>N-nothing too gauche.</p>
<p>Bye!</p>
<p>Hey, boss.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>[ Laughs ] The less I have to do, the more coffee I drink.</p>
<p>So, do you and Lena want to come and watch us get married?</p>
<p>Oh. Uh, Lena went to a trade conference in Prague, but, uh...You know, I'd be honored.</p>
<p>I thought you guys weren't having any guests.</p>
<p>Well, we kind of changed our minds.</p>
<p>It's just gonna be a few people -- a dozen, 15.</p>
<p>All right. I'm there.</p>
<p>Where and when?</p>
<p>We don't know yet.</p>
<p>It's nothing fancy.</p>
<p>Oh, well, you have to have it at our house. I insist.</p>
<p>We have the perfect spot for a casual wedding.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Hmm. I'd be thrilled.</p>
<p>That is so nice of you.</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ]</p>
<p>What's up? Some surprise, huh?</p>
<p>I didn't see the wedding thing coming.</p>
<p>It wasn't that hard to guess.</p>
<p>Something on your mind?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Actually, yes.</p>
<p>Someone might get in touch with you about me requesting a transfer.</p>
<p>I just wanted you to hear it from me first.</p>
<p>A transfer where?</p>
<p>Salt Lake.</p>
<p>Office there is starting a cyber-crime initiative.</p>
<p>They're looking for people.</p>
<p>It's desk work, but it's more my speed, I think.</p>
<p>Uh, let's face it, I didn't do that well when we were going after Keller.</p>
<p>It's not easy being in the bullpen.</p>
<p>Michelle's desk is right there, and...</p>
<p>Anyway, I think a change of pace would be good.</p>
<p>Plus, you're gonna be rebuilding the team.</p>
<p>This will pretty much give you a blank slate.</p>
<p>Come here.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Come here.</p>
<p>Ow!</p>
<p>Stop feeling sorry for yourself.</p>
<p>No, I'm not. You are.</p>
<p>You made some mistakes going after Keller?</p>
<p>Welcome to the club.</p>
<p>I bat .300 on a good day.</p>
<p>You miss Vega.</p>
<p>Now remember who she was.</p>
<p>She'd never run away from a challenge like this, and neither should you.</p>
<p>[ Sighs ] And you're right.</p>
<p>I have to rebuild the team, and I want to start with people that I know and trust.</p>
<p>So stick around.</p>
<p>Or what, you'll hit me again?</p>
<p>I'm asking you to stay, Wylie.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, good.</p>
<p>Check in with Tork.</p>
<p>I want to know what's going on at the house.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And Cho...</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>This is the ring we sent you a picture of.</p>
<p>It was my grandmother's.</p>
<p>Anne's dad gave it to me to propose with.</p>
<p>Which is sweet, but it's not really me, you know?</p>
<p>So we thought maybe we could take the diamond out, put it in a necklace or something.</p>
<p>Of course. Uh, may I -- may I see it?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Uh, let me get my loupe.</p>
<p>We'll just need to take a closer look at the stone.</p>
<p>Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p>I'm helping another customer right now, sir.</p>
<p>FBI -- give them back their ring right now, or I will be forced to shoot you.</p>
<p>Don't worry. Just kidding.</p>
<p>I don't even carry a real gun.</p>
<p>I have a lot of close friends that do, though.</p>
<p>What's happening?</p>
<p>All will be revealed. Their ring is in your right hand.</p>
<p>Uh, sir, you've made a mistake.</p>
<p>We've got the ring right here.</p>
<p>Uh, that's a replica.</p>
<p>A...replica?</p>
<p>He did a French drop to swap the valuable ring with a cheap replica.</p>
<p>French drop is a sleight-of-hand move. Not important.</p>
<p>That ring never belonged to your grandmother, and it's not a real diamond.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>He would study the ring that he just gave you, then break the sad news that your grandma's ring is a phony, and you'd be none the wiser.</p>
<p>[ Laughs ] This is insane.</p>
<p>Then you won't mind opening up your right hand, will you?</p>
<p>Open up your right hand, please, sir.</p>
<p>Holy moly.</p>
<p>Well, thank you for your assistance, folks.</p>
<p>I'll take it from here.</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Don't worry, ma'am. The real ring is in your hand.</p>
<p>Good day to you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>My pleasure.</p>
<p>So, my crooked friend, today is your lucky day.</p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p>[ Door closes ]</p>
<p>Well, on a normal day, you'd be off to the pokey now.</p>
<p>But as it happens...I'm in the market for a diamond ring.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>So show me your very best selection, please.</p>
<p>And, sir, if I see any glass... The cuffs will come out.</p>
<p>Nothing too gauche.</p>
<p>[ Knock on door ]</p>
<p>What's up?</p>
<p>Tork just called in from the crime scene.</p>
<p>No intact corpses in the basement, but a lot of body parts, badly burned and fragmented.</p>
<p>Have them rush the DNA tests.</p>
<p>Pull some strings if you have to.</p>
<p>Why the rush?</p>
<p>Still got a lot of media interest.</p>
<p>The bosses want to be able to announce we got the guy.</p>
<p>For that, we need a coroner's report, so let's get on it.</p>
<p>Okay, right away.</p>
<p>Hey, did Abbott give you the news?</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>We're having a real wedding at his house.</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>You're gonna be there, right?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>I could use your help with something if you're not too busy.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>What he said.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing this.</p>
<p>I asked you along 'cause I thought you'd be honest.</p>
<p>I had no idea you were such a fashion expert.</p>
<p>Not me.</p>
<p>My mom could run up a designer gown before breakfast, cut her cloth by eye.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>My mom had a sewing machine, but it was always in hock.</p>
<p>She'd be very proud of you.</p>
<p>Looking like this?</p>
<p>Very proud.</p>

<p>Excuse me. I need to fill out a marriage license.</p>
<p>Um, usually there's two of you.</p>
<p>She's running late. I'll get started.</p>
<p>Okay, well, uh, paperwork is in the end tray.</p>
<p>Just fill that out.</p>
<p>We need both of you here, plus I.D.</p>
<p>I see. Will do, thanks.</p>

<p>City clerk's office. Please hold.</p>
<p>Thanks for holding. Yes, how may I help you?</p>
<p>No, ma'am. You can't file online.</p>
<p>Until 6:00, but we're closed -- okay, bye.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>Looks like she stood me up.</p>
<p>Bad omen for a wedding, huh?</p>
<p>Abbott.</p>
<p>Can I run something by you?</p>
<p>Yeah, shoot.</p>
<p>Spot DNA test came back from the Keller house.</p>
<p>So far, all the recovered body parts belong to Joe Sr. -- None for Jr.</p>
<p>They found his gun, but not him.</p>
<p>[ Sighs ] Oh, damn.</p>
<p>It could be that he was at the epicenter of the explosion and was vaporized, but there's a strong possibility that Keller, a.k.a. Lazarus, is still alive.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>I let Austin P.D. know, and we're putting out a BOLO to all the local hospitals.</p>
<p>Wylie's putting together a k.a. list, and I'm gonna have agents set up shop at all of them.</p>
<p>Well, did you put out a wire just in case --</p>
<p>He runs for the border, yeah.</p>
<p>All right, well, it seems like you have everything handled.</p>
<p>I don't know if I should tell Jane and Lisbon.</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wouldn't.</p>
<p>We don't have enough to be sure.</p>
<p>And, you know, they're in a good space right now.</p>
<p>If Lisbon found out that this case isn't closed, it's likely that she'll cancel the wedding and join the hunt.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's plenty of time to tell them after.</p>
<p>But...if he's still alive, you know, Keller's unpredictable, and Jane did try to kill him.</p>
<p>You know, just in case, why don't we put some bodies at the wedding, just to keep an eye out.</p>
<p>And it's my house, so I'll arrange it.</p>
<p>You sure?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>It's something to keep me busy.</p>
<p>Okay, thanks.</p>
<p>Abbott said it's totally up to you, but that you'd probably prefer to hold the ceremony outside, and there isn't really a room inside big enough.</p>
<p>Well, how many people are we talking about?</p>
<p>Oh! A lot of people are talking about it.</p>
<p>Well, we only invited like 15 people.</p>
<p>Mm...more like 25 or --</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>And I don't think people are waiting for, like, a printed invitation... seeing as there isn't one.</p>
<p>But, hey, o-on the plus side, you're popular, girl!</p>
<p>Is that what all these tables are for?</p>
<p>Yeah, Abbott thought they'd be useful. Don't worry.</p>
<p>He's covering the rental... and the bartender... and the caterer.</p>
<p>I guess they're his wedding gift. I don't know.</p>
<p>Hey, here's a menu.</p>
<p>There's a caterer?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.</p>
<p>Abbott's loaded. I mean, look at this house.</p>
<p>I think his wife cleaned up in the private sector.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Here we are.</p>
<p>Hey, everybody out.</p>
<p>Hey, Teresa!</p>

<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>Oh, T, this is Lucy, my fiancée.</p>
<p>Aah!</p>
<p>Lucy, Teresa.</p>
<p>I am so freaked out to meet you at last.</p>
<p>We're gonna be sisters! Yay!</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>It's a long story. [ Chuckles ]</p>
<p>So, you're all here. Welcome to Austin.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Yeah, it looks like we brought the weather with us.</p>
<p>FBI! [ Laughs ]</p>
<p>Sorry, I'm freaking out right now. [ Laughs ]</p>
<p>Yeah, we got that.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>You all came.</p>
<p>Yeah. Already said that, t.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: Let's go in!</p>
<p>Jason! Jason! Come here!</p>
<p>Yeah! Okay.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ] Yay.</p>
<p>[ Indistinct shouting ]</p>
<p>[ Sighs ]</p>
<p>[ Knock on door ]</p>
<p>Uh, excuse me, sir.</p>
<p>We have an odd coincidence...</p>
<p>Or not. Maybe.</p>
<p>Austin P.D. got a missing-person's report on a local television reporter named Dan Glover.</p>
<p>The one that interviewed Jane.</p>
<p>Yeah, left work Thursday night, hasn't been seen since.</p>
<p>The weird thing is, he called here right around the time he was last seen. I spoke to him.</p>
<p>He said he wanted to interview Jane again, and I said he was unavailable because he was getting...married.</p>
<p>So, you're not even sure if you spoke to Glover?</p>
<p>No, I mean, I was certain at the time.</p>
<p>Obviously, it was his caller I.D., but now --</p>
<p>So, we have to assume the killer's alive and looking for Jane.</p>
<p>How many agents are you gonna have at the wedding?</p>
<p>Four, but now I think we should probably have more.</p>
<p>At least 10.</p>
<p>We're gonna need eyes on the front and backyards and the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>We should have a chopper on standby in case we need to pursue.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>But wouldn't it be wiser to just postpone the wedding?</p>
<p>Postpone the wedding?</p>
<p>We're the FBI.</p>
<p>There is that upside.</p>
<p>We can use the wedding as bait...kind of.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go check on that chopper.</p>
<p>Still think we shouldn't tell Jane and Lisbon?</p>
<p>We're the FBI.</p>
<p>Just like you said, we can handle it.</p>
<p>[ Indistinct conversations ]</p>
<p><strong>Patrick</strong>: Abbott.</p>
<p>Hmm? Hey.</p>
<p>[ Telephone ringing ]</p>
<p>What were you and Cho and Tork huddled about?</p>
<p>Nothing special.</p>
<p>Nothing special that's keeping you here when you could be in Prague with your lovely wife?</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ]</p>
<p>You know, she doesn't need me around.</p>
<p>I...I get in the way.</p>
<p>[ Laughs ] You're lying to me.</p>
<p>I won't pursue the point because you would tell me if it was something important.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>I-if I thought that it was something that we couldn't handle.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>You know, um... I've been getting some calls about you, and my bosses want to know if you're sticking around.</p>
<p>That's a good question.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>All right, well, no pressure.</p>
<p>But if you're going, there is some legal stuff that we need to handle to expunge that deal that we made.</p>
<p>The napkin?</p>
<p>Mm-hmm. [ Laughs ]</p>
<p>I'm getting married tomorrow.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Then I'm building a house, and...beyond that, I genuinely have no idea.</p>
<p>And I can't do this job forever, but it's gonna be tough to give up.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's hard giving up making a difference, huh?</p>
<p>No, everyone makes a difference.</p>
<p>Hard to give up the chase.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>That it is.</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ]</p>
<p>So, you, uh, let me know when you know.</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>It has been very good working with you, Patrick.</p>
<p>You too, Dennis.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your honesty.</p>
<p>I love you for that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>[ Sighs ]</p>
<p>Okay, you got me. I was lying.</p>
<p>There is something I need to talk to you about.</p>
<p>[ Sighs ]</p>
<p>[ Sniffles ]</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Nice flowers.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>They're centerpieces.</p>
<p>It's a Sylvan theme.</p>
<p>Sylvan theme.</p>
<p>All right. Cool, I guess.</p>
<p>How many...people are actually coming to this thing?</p>
<p>Nobody knows exactly. [ Sighs ]</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>[ Crying ] How did this happen? This is not what I wanted.</p>
<p>[ Sighs deeply ]</p>
<p>Well, I like the Sylvan theme.</p>
<p>We should have just eloped like you said.</p>
<p>What about your family?</p>
<p>Oh, they wouldn't care.</p>
<p>I just talked to them at the hotel.</p>
<p>They found a minibar.</p>
<p>They're like cavemen arguing over a dead antelope.</p>
<p>All right, well, uh... Let's run, huh?</p>
<p>We'll tell nobody, just the judge.</p>
<p>I'll have her meet us at our little cabin tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>The cabin?</p>
<p>Just us.</p>
<p>What, you think the judge would do that?</p>
<p>Well, sure.</p>
<p>I mean, she's driving in from San Antonio tonight.</p>
<p>Change of venue makes no difference to her.</p>
<p>Well, what about the witnesses?</p>
<p>We'll get someone, a park ranger.</p>
<p>[ Chuckles ]</p>
<p>You know what? Let's do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's our life, damn it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I love you, too.</p>
<p>Hey, there's a --</p>
<p>I'm gonna go get my dress, and I'm gonna go to the Airstream.</p>
<p>I'll meet you there.</p>
<p>Well, there's another very good reason why we should elope, all right?</p>
<p>Keller is apparently still alive, and he's mad at me for some reason.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>Yeah, so Cho and his people are gonna stake out this house.</p>
<p>When Keller shows up, they'll nab him.</p>
<p>You were gonna withhold this information from me?</p>
<p>You were gonna deprive me of a guilt-free elopement?</p>
<p>I just told you.</p>
<p>You almost didn't!</p>
<p>From now on, we need to be 100% honest with each other.</p>
<p>I agree with you 100%.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Honesty.</p>
<p>I am gonna go... Get my dress.</p>
<p>Fire up the Airstream.</p>
<p>You go, girl.</p>
<p>Hi. Judge Hamilton, Patrick Jane.</p>
<p>Uh, there's been a change of venue.</p>
<p>Okay. No problem, Mr. Jane.</p>
<p>If you just text me the exact address and perhaps a decent motel nearby.</p>
<p>I'll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Great. Bye.</p>
<p>[ Door closes ]</p>

<p>We got four agents on the roof, five dressed as catering and valet service, six on the perimeter, and six undercover mobiles covering the approach roads.</p>
<p>When the guests get here, I'll gather them inside and explain the situation.</p>
<p>Most of them are law enforcement, so they'll understand.</p>
<p>What is it, Wylie?</p>
<p>Office got a call off the BOLO from a clerk at the south Austin registry office.</p>
<p>A man with extensive burns came in yesterday and pretended to fill out a form.</p>
<p>The clerk thinks he may have taken a peek at the marriage-license forms on her desk.</p>
<p>So that confirms it. He<em> is</em> coming to the wedding.</p>
<p>Well, we got it covered.</p>
<p>Why are you so anxious, Wylie?</p>
<p>I know all the state forms from when I used to work downtown.</p>
<p>The marriage-license form doesn't ask where the wedding is.</p>
<p>It just asks who the officiant is.</p>
<p>Well, that's the judge.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>And, you, Teresa, do you take Patrick to be your lawful, wedded husband, to have and to hold in sickness and health, for better or for worse, till death do you part?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Then by the power granted me by the state of Texas, I declare you husband and wife.</p>
