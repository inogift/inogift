<p class="full-script"><em>Previously on &quot;The Mentalist&quot;...</em></p>
<p class="full-script">This is my date outfit.</p>
<p class="full-script">Is this your first date? I mean, um, since your wife died.</p>
<p class="full-script">Do I seem out of practice?</p>
<p class="full-script"><em>Red John, if you're listening to us now, I urge you to reach out and get help.</em></p>
<p class="full-script">You can change.</p>
<p class="full-script"><strong>Patrick</strong>: What the hell are you thinking?</p>
<p class="full-script">Don't you understand who you're dealing with?</p>
<p class="full-script">Red John is not coming after me. You've done exactly what I did, are you blind?</p>
<p class="full-script">You've done exactly what I did, and he killed my wife and child.</p>
<p class="full-script"><strong>Van Pelt</strong>: Kristina?</p>
<p class="full-script"><strong>Patrick</strong>: Red John could've gotten in and taken her, or maybe he lured her out somehow.</p>
<p class="full-script"><strong>Man</strong>: Aah!</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot;Tiger, tiger, burning bright... In the forests of the night, what immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry?&quot;</p>
<p class="full-script">(Gunshot)</p>
<p class="full-script">(Gasps)</p>
<p class="full-script">I almost forgot. Kristina would want me to send her love.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Indistinct conversations)</p>
<p class="full-script">(Police radio chatter)</p>
<p class="full-script">You can't park there.</p>
<p class="full-script">Sure, I can. Look.</p>
<p class="full-script"><strong>Man</strong>: Roger. Stand by.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Speaks indistinctly)</p>
<p class="full-script">We'll call you back.</p>
<p class="full-script">There you are.</p>
<p class="full-script">Here I am. Good morning.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why so glum?</p>
<p class="full-script">This is Harvey Dublin.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's his chauffeur Peter Russo with three bullets in him.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's his car. Mr. Dublin's gone.</p>
<p class="full-script">Abducted, it looks like.</p>
<p class="full-script">Harvey Dublin?</p>
<p class="full-script">Big-time statehouse lobbyist, lawyer, kingmaker. Famous and well-connected.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ah, the evil twins.</p>
<p class="full-script">Brass and media are gonna be all over us like suckerfish.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, why don't we just give it to the FBI? They love that stuff.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, I wish. Too late.</p>
<p class="full-script">The new boss is here doing on-cameras. It's our baby.</p>
<p class="full-script">New boss?</p>
<p class="full-script">I thought Hightower was boss.</p>
<p class="full-script">The boss of Hightower.</p>
<p class="full-script">The Director of the entire Division.</p>
<p class="full-script">I told you about him last week. Your memory's going.</p>
<p class="full-script">My memory is a mighty fortress, Lisbon, from which no fact ever escapes once committed.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now when you tell me boring things, I set 'em free immediately.</p>
<p class="full-script">Saves overcrowding.</p>
<p class="full-script">Harvey Dublin is missing.</p>
<p class="full-script">It looks like a kidnapping, presumably for ransom, but we can't be sure at present.</p>
<p class="full-script">We shall have to await further developments.</p>
<p class="full-script">Harvey is a pillar of this city, one of the good guys.</p>
<p class="full-script">We are all praying for his safety.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script"><strong>Woman</strong>: Over here, Mr. Bertram. One more question for me?</p>
<p class="full-script">Idiot.</p>
<p class="full-script">You and your snap judgments. What is he supposed to say?</p>
<p class="full-script">Why does he have to say anything?</p>
<p class="full-script">What's your take on this?</p>
<p class="full-script">Hmm.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't know.</p>
<p class="full-script"><strong>Woman</strong>: Mr. Bertram, over here. Can I have your attention?</p>
<p class="full-script">Eh, I think I'll give this one a miss.</p>
<p class="full-script">A miss?</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you mean &quot;a miss&quot;?</p>
<p class="full-script">I just feel this one is not for me.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll catch the next one, I-I-I promise.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't understand. You're not gonna—</p>
<p class="full-script">Agent Lisbon, I believe? And Mr. Jane?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes. Hi.</p>
<p class="full-script">Director Bertram will speak to you now.</p>
<p class="full-script">We're on a supertight schedule. He appreciate facts and brevity.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay?</p>
<p class="full-script">Agent Lisbon.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, sir, director Bertram.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Chuckles) And you must be our boy wonder Patrick Jane.</p>
<p class="full-script">I've heard a lot of good things about you. Hi. Nice to meet you, sir.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now I want this resolved A.S.A.P.</p>
<p class="full-script">Whatever it takes. The heck with overtime restrictions.</p>
<p class="full-script">You do the hours, I'll find the funding.</p>
<p class="full-script">We are all in this together as one.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's what I'm all about. Oh, we are on it, sir.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, yeah, I won't be working this particular case, but I-I do like what you said.</p>
<p class="full-script">We're all in this together as one. Mao tse-tung, right?</p>
<p class="full-script">Now hold your horses there, Buster.</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you mean you won't working on this one?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, statehouse lobbyist abductions— it's, uh, not really my cup of tea.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, that's—that's kind of unprofessional, don't you think?</p>
<p class="full-script">I guess, but I'm not actually a professional.</p>
<p class="full-script">Question for you.</p>
<p class="full-script">W-why are you here?</p>
<p class="full-script">Aside from the cameras.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, what do you mean, &quot;aside from the cameras&quot;?</p>
<p class="full-script">Public perception is an important tool.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mm.</p>
<p class="full-script">Tool. Ooh.</p>
<p class="full-script">You just put your hand on me.</p>
<p class="full-script">No. I mean, yes, but— yes, you did. Don't ever do that again.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Chuckles) Or else what?</p>
<p class="full-script">You ever smell a dead mouse?</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you remember that smell?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, I just now put a dead mouse in your Jacket pocket.</p>
<p class="full-script">And no matter how many times you clean that Jacket, you'll always smell that dead mouse, and you'll remember that you should <em>never</em> have put your hand on me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Aah! You son of a bitch.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's actually just a wadded up napkin but, uh, has the same psychological effect.</p>
<p class="full-script">Human mind is funny that way.</p>
<p class="full-script">Good to meet you, sir. Sorry, Lisbon.</p>
<p class="full-script">He had a rough summer.</p>

Red Sky at Night<br />
Original Air Date on September 23, 2010</p>
<p class="full-script"><strong>Lisbon</strong>: Rigsby and Van Pelt are canvassing the area around the abduction site.</p>
<p class="full-script">Cho's with Mrs. Dublin, waiting for a ransom demand, and tech services are up and running.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, this is a Scary one. Lots of attention.</p>
<p class="full-script">Keep Molly in public affairs apprised of any good stuff we can feed the media, keep them on our side, and don't make any mistakes.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, ma'am.</p>
<p class="full-script">How's Jane?</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sets down cup)</p>
<p class="full-script">The same.</p>
<p class="full-script">You think he's in danger of cracking up?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, no. Well, I don't think so. I think he'll be fine.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Papers rustle)</p>
<p class="full-script">That's not very convincing, Lisbon.</p>
<p class="full-script">What he's been through would break anyone.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's not gonna crack up.</p>
<p class="full-script">I think some time off will do him good, though.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, well, no can do.</p>
<p class="full-script">Bertram wants him on the Dublin case.</p>
<p class="full-script">After Jane was so rude to him?</p>
<p class="full-script">Bertram's all bottom line.</p>
<p class="full-script">He won't let personal issues intrude.</p>
<p class="full-script">Jane's the best asset we have, and Bertram knows that.</p>
<p class="full-script">But Jane doesn't want to be on the case. Change his mind.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not gonna tell Bertram we can't control our own people.</p>
<p class="full-script">I have an idea as to how to persuade him, but it's kind of unethical.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't wanna know.</p>
<p class="full-script">Where's Jane?</p>
<p class="full-script">He's Upstairs.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thanks.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Knocks on door)</p>
<p class="full-script">Jane?</p>
<p class="full-script">Come in.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey.</p>
<p class="full-script">Nice place.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sighs) Yeah. Yeah, I like the view and the quiet.</p>
<p class="full-script">And what are you doing with all the quiet?</p>
<p class="full-script">Just thinking.</p>
<p class="full-script">Jane, you have to stop blaming yourself.</p>
<p class="full-script">If Red John took Kristina frye, it's not your— there's no &quot;if&quot; he took her.</p>
<p class="full-script">If he <em>did, </em> you can't blame yourself.</p>
<p class="full-script">Besides, what good is it to sit up here, scribbling in your book? You're not gonna find her that way.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Chuckles)</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not gonna change my mind.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't want to work the Dublin case.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's fine. It's a done deal. I understand.</p>
<p class="full-script">It'd be good for you to have a break.</p>
<p class="full-script">Listen, on a completely other subject, I need a personal favor.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'd like you to come and meet someone.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who?</p>
<p class="full-script">I can't tell.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why not?</p>
<p class="full-script">I promise it has nothing to do with Harvey Dublin.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're trying to play me somehow, convince me to change my mind.</p>
<p class="full-script">No. Yes, you are.</p>
<p class="full-script">And I guess I owe you a shot.</p>
<p class="full-script">But it's not gonna work, whatever it is.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, Cho, how's it goin' with Mrs. Dublin?</p>
<p class="full-script">Nothing so far. When's somebody coming to relieve me here?</p>
<p class="full-script">Why? What's the problem?</p>
<p class="full-script">Nothing. I'll call if we get any developments.</p>
<p class="full-script">What is it? Is it Harvey?</p>
<p class="full-script">No, ma'am.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Cries) Oh, my God!</p>
<p class="full-script">I am gonna explode! I can't stand it!</p>
<p class="full-script">I can't take it! I swear to God!</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sobs)</p>
<p class="full-script">Why, Kimball? (Sniffles)</p>
<p class="full-script">Why am I being punished?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm a good person.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, ma'am.</p>
<p class="full-script">Stop calling me &quot;ma'am&quot;&quot;</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not your grandmother.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sniffles)</p>
<p class="full-script">How old do you think I am anyway?</p>
<p class="full-script">48, 49.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sobbing)</p>
<p class="full-script">I get the picture. Do you?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, Dublin's driver— the dead guy, Pete Russo, right?</p>
<p class="full-script">He has family.</p>
<p class="full-script">He wasn't wearing a wedding ring, so, uh...</p>
<p class="full-script">(Doorbell rings)</p>
<p class="full-script">We're about to meet a, uh...</p>
<p class="full-script">(Door squeaks)</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes. Exactly.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, who are you?</p>
<p class="full-script">Nadine, I'm Agent Lisbon with the CBI.</p>
<p class="full-script">We spoke on the phone. This is Patrick Jane.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hi. You're, uh, Pete Russo's daughter?</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, yeah.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hello?</p>
<p class="full-script">They're police.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Whispers) Oh, okay. This is my mom.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Normal voice) Patricia.</p>
<p class="full-script">And this is Keith, my stepdad.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hi. Um...</p>
<p class="full-script">Please come in.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sighs)</p>
<p class="full-script">Miss Lisbon says you're the best Detective in California.</p>
<p class="full-script">She says if anybody can find who killed my father, you can.</p>
<p class="full-script">I just have to say, I didn't think you would stoop to such crude manipulation.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't understand.</p>
<p class="full-script">Inside joke. I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, I will find who killed your father and abducted Mr. Dublin.</p>
<p class="full-script">An inside <em>joke? </em></p>
<p class="full-script">Her father is dead.</p>
<p class="full-script">Murdered.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're making jokes?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, uh, it's a fault of mine.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, what it is, the joke?</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, I have a—I have a lot on mind right now.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, I didn't really wanna come to work today, but my good friend and colleague Agent Lisbon tricked me into meeting you, knowing that I couldn't refuse you because you're the age my daughter would be if she were still alive, if she hadn't been murdered.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Gasps) Oh, goodness.</p>
<p class="full-script">Murdered by a man named Red John, whom I met with recently.</p>
<p class="full-script">He saved my life and abducted a friend of mine.</p>
<p class="full-script">Long story. Hence, many things on my mind.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Slurps)</p>
<p class="full-script">That's not a very funny joke.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hmm.</p>
<p class="full-script">What happened to your friend?</p>
<p class="full-script">Still missing.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, please, tell us about your father.</p>
<p class="full-script">He was a good person.</p>
<p class="full-script">He was... funny and... (Voice breaks)</p>
<p class="full-script">And generous.</p>
<p class="full-script">And I could talk to him about anything, and he would listen.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Patricia) Oh, yes, he could be charming.</p>
<p class="full-script">He had his ways.</p>
<p class="full-script">What kind of ways?</p>
<p class="full-script">He had a temper.</p>
<p class="full-script">That he did.</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, his heart was in the right place, you know?</p>
<p class="full-script">Whatever his faults, he didn't deserve to die this way.</p>
<p class="full-script">Really, I'm impressed.</p>
<p class="full-script">Youand you lied to me.</p>
<p class="full-script">I kind of did, didn't I? Sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, I'm glad to see you're finally learning a few things.</p>
<p class="full-script">Of course, uh, now I shall have my revenge. What do you mean?</p>
<p class="full-script">(Chuckles) Ahh.</p>
<p class="full-script"><strong>Rigsby</strong>: Don't worry. We're not here about drugs.</p>
<p class="full-script">We're here about the killing the other night.</p>
<p class="full-script"><strong>Man</strong>: Ah, yeah, yeah. I heard about that.</p>
<p class="full-script">Kidnapped a man, huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">That's too bad.</p>
<p class="full-script">Local beat cops say you guys do business under that bridge. Yeah, look, the local beat cops are nice guys, but they're out of touch.</p>
<p class="full-script">We don't do business under that bridge. The hos—they got dibs.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're gonna wanna talk to the ladies over on Fremont.</p>
<p class="full-script">All right. Thanks. Yeah, no worries.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, hey, Red.</p>
<p class="full-script">You—you ever date a hustler before?</p>
<p class="full-script">Not so far!</p>
<p class="full-script">What? I'm kidding.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah. Okay. Good to know.</p>
<p class="full-script">Good afternoon. Reid Colman. I'm Mr. Dublin's personal lawyer.</p>
<p class="full-script">Glad to see you people. You made any progress?</p>
<p class="full-script">Early days, Mr. Colman. You'll, uh, need to talk to me, yes?</p>
<p class="full-script">Now's a good time. I have ten minutes or so.</p>
<p class="full-script">If you'll come this way, we can use the conference room.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, just a moment.</p>
<p class="full-script">What's your name?</p>
<p class="full-script">Marjorie.</p>
<p class="full-script">Marjorie. That's a very nice name.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'd like to speak to Marjorie first, thanks.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sighs)</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, we will need to speak to you in due course, sir.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll, uh, try and fit you in later.</p>
<p class="full-script">Prostitutes? No. No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mr. Dublin was not that sort of man at all.</p>
<p class="full-script">The alleyway from which he was abducted was used by prostitutes, and it was nowhere near Mr. Dublin's regular route.</p>
<p class="full-script">I have been Mr. Dublin's personal secretary for ten years, and I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that he is the most decent, caring, clean, generous human being that anyone could hope to meet.</p>
<p class="full-script">We want to bring him back safely, Marjorie.</p>
<p class="full-script">We need to know everything.</p>
<p class="full-script">Usually I can get ahold of him at any time.</p>
<p class="full-script">His work demands it, but once in a while, he'd disappear for an hour or so, no—no answer from him or his driver.</p>
<p class="full-script">How often was that?</p>
<p class="full-script">Every couple of weeks.</p>
<p class="full-script">A regular date right around the time he was abducted, yes?</p>
<p class="full-script">And what did you think he might be doing?</p>
<p class="full-script">Mistress, I thought, but not this.</p>
<p class="full-script">Men have needs. I understand that.</p>
<p class="full-script">Please, you'll find him, won't you? You'll find him?</p>
<p class="full-script">Marjorie, uh, I have to tell you, uh, it's very likely that he's already dead.</p>
<p class="full-script">Whoa. Wait a minute. We don't know that.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's a hunch that I have, and if I'm right, it's a blessing for you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Unrequited love is a terrible thing.</p>
<p class="full-script">You have to find yourself a man that will love you back.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're a good woman. You deserve it. Think about that.</p>
<p class="full-script">So this was done by someone who knew about Dublin's routine— someone very close.</p>
<p class="full-script">Wh-why did you say he was dead?</p>
<p class="full-script">Because he is. He's dead, and it's not a kidnapping.</p>
<p class="full-script">Give me a reason.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll bet you all the tea in China.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Cell phone rings)</p>
<p class="full-script">(Scoffs)</p>
<p class="full-script">That is not a reason.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll give you good odds.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Ring)</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey. Ransom demand came through.</p>
<p class="full-script">How much?</p>
<p class="full-script">All right. We're on our way.</p>
<p class="full-script">A million dollars for the safe return of Dublin— that kinda sounds like a kidnapping, doesn't it?</p>
<p class="full-script">Doesn't mean it's a kidnapping. Doesn't mean he's not dead.</p>
<p class="full-script">Is this a serious theory, or is this your revenge?</p>
<p class="full-script"><strong>Cho</strong>: This was sent from a throwaway phone.</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot;Do exactly as instructed or H.D. gets his throat cut and we send you his tongue. We want a million dollars in used $50s and $100s at 0600 tomorrow. Location will follow. No police, or H.D. Is dead&quot;</p>
<p class="full-script">Any proof of life?</p>
<p class="full-script">No. Huh.</p>
<p class="full-script">Do not say anything bad to Mrs. Dublin.</p>
<p class="full-script">That is an order.</p>
<p class="full-script">Jawohl, mein kommandant. Can I see?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah.</p>
<p class="full-script">Where is Mrs. Dublin?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, she cries a lot. Then she has to freshen her makeup, and then she cries again. Sort of a cycle.</p>
<p class="full-script">Three deliberate misspellings and an obvious military lilt, which suggests that the writer is not a veteran but wants us to believe that he or she is— so a notch or two less clever than he or she thinks that they are, using this crime to express some kind of deep, personal grudge.</p>
<p class="full-script">The violence is authentic enough.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, my lord. What now?</p>
<p class="full-script">What's happened?</p>
<p class="full-script">It's—it's nothing, Giselle.</p>
<p class="full-script">These are my colleagues. Please remain calm.</p>
<p class="full-script">How can I remain calm?</p>
<p class="full-script">I can't raise a million dollars by tomorrow!</p>
<p class="full-script">We aren't nearly as rich as people think.</p>
<p class="full-script">Wh-what do I do?</p>
<p class="full-script">I can't speak to the financial aspects, ma'am.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's your call.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now can you think of anybody who may have had a personal grudge against your husband?</p>
<p class="full-script">No. Nobody.</p>
<p class="full-script">My husband is a respected and beloved member of Sacramento society.</p>
<p class="full-script">And you?</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you respect and <em>belove</em> him?</p>
<p class="full-script">Of course I do.</p>
<p class="full-script">Deeply. What a question.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, wh-why don't you want to raise a million dollars to save his life?</p>
<p class="full-script">Why do you ask that? I do!</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, the watch and the earrings— that's, like, quarter mil right there.</p>
<p class="full-script">You can raise the money. You're conflicted, because you don't know if you want your husband back.</p>
<p class="full-script">You don't like your husband very much at all.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're actually a very good actress playing the part of the loving wife.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's what I think you are.</p>
<p class="full-script">Can you look at me and tell me that I'm wrong?</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sighs)</p>
<p class="full-script">Duh.</p>
<p class="full-script">Of course I don't like him very much.</p>
<p class="full-script">Everybody in the know knows that Harvey Dublin is a mean, lying, backstabbing, crooked son of a bitch.</p>
<p class="full-script">But I'm his wife, and what am I supposed to do but act like I love him?</p>
<p class="full-script">Why didn't you leave him?</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sighs) Have you ever divorced a mean lawyer?</p>
<p class="full-script">He has no record of any personal wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's a respected lobbyist.</p>
<p class="full-script">An extortionist and con man, more like it.</p>
<p class="full-script">So there are a lot of people who may have wanted to harm your husband.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you kidding?</p>
<p class="full-script">There's people all over the city praying that he stays gone.</p>
<p class="full-script">How about you?</p>
<p class="full-script">Me?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, I'll raise the money. I owe him that much.</p>
<p class="full-script">I knew what I was marrying.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, Mr. Dublin is the target of some lawsuits.</p>
<p class="full-script">Most prominent men are at one point or another in their careers. It's a hazard of modern life.</p>
<p class="full-script">So Harvey Dublin's a Saint. That's your position?</p>
<p class="full-script">No, Harvey Dublin is not a Saint, but I'm his lawyer, and I speak for him.</p>
<p class="full-script">Look, Harvey started with less than nothing.</p>
<p class="full-script">He was a street kid. His parents were drug addicts.</p>
<p class="full-script">He lives in fear of falling back into that world, so maybe he pushes a little bit too hard.</p>
<p class="full-script">Maybe he's just a little bit too intense in his desire to win. This is America. That's no crime.</p>
<p class="full-script">Seven lawsuits pending.</p>
<p class="full-script">Look, anyone can get sued. It doesn't mean a thing.</p>
<p class="full-script">Half the players in this town are in bed with Dublin one way or another. In fact, your, uh, your new director, Gale Bertram— he's one of his codefendants. Really?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah. <em>Bank of Claremont vs.</p>
<p class="full-script">Brixham Lake development corporation and others.</em></p>
<p class="full-script">It's gonna be a blockbuster. Do go on.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's a complex land/water rights thing.</p>
<p class="full-script">It'll run for years.</p>
<p class="full-script">The point is, Bertram was named codefendant to put pressure on the defense to settle early.</p>
<p class="full-script">Happens all the time. Hmm. That's interesting about Bertram.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, it's not. Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who's to gain the most, legally speaking, if Mr. Dublin doesn't return?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, that's, uh, that's hard to say.</p>
<p class="full-script">Too many variables in the equation.</p>
<p class="full-script">But he is coming back, right?</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, if Giselle pays the kidnappers, why shouldn't he?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, stuff happens.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, did you ever serve in the military, Mr. Colman?</p>
<p class="full-script">No, I didn't have that honor. Why do you ask?</p>
<p class="full-script">Standard question.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Speaks inaudibly)</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, hey, don't just—</p>
<p class="full-script">(scoffs) Oh, shoot.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, Lady, wait up.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ma'am, we just want to talk.</p>
<p class="full-script">Blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, blah, blah, blah. Listen, did you hear about that guy that was kidnapped up the street a couple blocks over?</p>
<p class="full-script">His driver was shot dead. Oh, that. Yeah. Isn't that wild?</p>
<p class="full-script">Everybody's talking about it.</p>
<p class="full-script">What exactly are people saying?</p>
<p class="full-script">All kinds of stuff. Friend of mine said she was there.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, yeah?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, she's acting all mysterious, like, &quot;I can't tell you what happened, &quot; like she's a secret Agent or whatnot. What's your friend's name?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yours for $50.</p>
<p class="full-script">This is a murder investigation.</p>
<p class="full-script">We could take you in right now for obstruction.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, baby, save yourself time and paperwork.</p>
<p class="full-script">I got 40... 43 bucks.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh... 12 cents.</p>
<p class="full-script">Money's tight all over, huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">Come on. Cut us a break here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Sugar—big ole tall girl, pink hair.</p>
<p class="full-script">She'll be around tomorrow night.</p>
<p class="full-script">Nice doin' business with ya.</p>
<p class="full-script">12 cents? Seriously?</p>
<p class="full-script">What? (Sighs)</p>
<p class="full-script">She cleaned me out.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Chuckles) 12 cents.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ah.</p>
<p class="full-script">Interesting about Bertram, huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">You said that before. No, it's not.</p>
<p class="full-script">I got a weird vibe the first moment I met him.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, the director of the division of law enforcement did not kidnap Harvey Dublin.</p>
<p class="full-script">So you think. How well do you know him?</p>
<p class="full-script">This is your revenge, isn't it?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, I-I am simply gonna ignore you.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not punishing you, though you do deserve it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dublin turned out to be the sleazebag I guessed he was.</p>
<p class="full-script">He deserves justice like everybody else.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, you're a cop. You have to say that.</p>
<p class="full-script">You don't really believe it.</p>
<p class="full-script">My fingers are in my ears.</p>
<p class="full-script">Morning!</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey!</p>
<p class="full-script">What's happening?</p>
<p class="full-script">Nothing yet. No kidding. Where's the money?</p>
<p class="full-script">Trash can down there. There?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh. Just as I thought. No one's gonna show up.</p>
<p class="full-script">Look at this place. It's far too open for a ransom drop. Well, they said no police, and maybe they're stupid enough to think that there's no police.</p>
<p class="full-script">They killed a guy in the street.</p>
<p class="full-script">They have to know the police are involved. (Sighs)</p>
<p class="full-script">They never intended to pick up the ransom.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, my hunch is correct. The kidnapping's a sham.</p>
<p class="full-script">Dublin's already dead.</p>
<p class="full-script">What would be the reason for a pretend kidnapping?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, that is the salient question, yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">But you can stop wasting your time here, certainly.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, did Mrs. Dublin use real money or fake money?</p>
<p class="full-script">Real.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did you look at it?</p>
<p class="full-script">No. What would that matter now?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm—you know, I'm just a little curious.</p>
<p class="full-script">What you're saying might be true and it might not be.</p>
<p class="full-script">We still have to sit on this thing for a little while to make sure nobody shows up—couple of hours.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, that's just silly.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's not silly. It's professional. Professional sh-messional.</p>
<p class="full-script">Jane.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Clatters)</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, it's real!</p>
<p class="full-script">Police! Freeze! Hands in the air!</p>
<p class="full-script">Get on your knees! Do it now! Do it now! Okay.</p>
<p class="full-script">Don't move.</p>
<p class="full-script"><strong>Man</strong>: The director is expecting a full but concise progress report. How's that Jacket smell?</p>
<p class="full-script">This is a different suit.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, but the other one's ruined, isn't it? Hmm?</p>
<p class="full-script">Power of suggestion.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, you know what?</p>
<p class="full-script">Bite me.</p>
<p class="full-script">So... Poor Harvey Dublin, huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">Sir, no one picked up the ransom drop, so for that and other reasons, we believe that the kidnapping aspect of this case is a pretense.</p>
<p class="full-script">Masking what?</p>
<p class="full-script">That we can't say for sure.</p>
<p class="full-script">We have promising leads. Well, I need something to tell the media.</p>
<p class="full-script">Tell 'em Harvey Dublin's dead.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, I'm so glad you decided to work on this case, Mr. Jane.</p>
<p class="full-script">Your directness is bracing.</p>
<p class="full-script">Of course, procedurally, we're still assuming he's alive, until we have proof positive otherwise.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why kill Dublin?</p>
<p class="full-script">Wh-what's the motive?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, two possibilities.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, one—simple robbery.</p>
<p class="full-script">The culprit was going after the diamond that, uh, Dublin always carries on him.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Chuckles)</p>
<p class="full-script">Diamond? What diamond?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, apparently, Dublin had a terror of falling back into poverty, of, uh, dying in a pauper's grave like his father did, so he always carried a large diamond with him, just in case.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's kind of a touching story, isn't it?</p>
<p class="full-script">So someone staged this abduction to steal the diamond.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay. Um, where's your evidence for this?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, no actual evidence.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's—that's word on the street. It's more like a theory, really.</p>
<p class="full-script">Word on the street. Jane.</p>
<p class="full-script">So you have nothing?</p>
<p class="full-script">You—you said there were two possibilities?</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, the other reason someone would kill him is, uh... b-b-b-Brixham Lake.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, wait a second. What about Brixham Lake?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, it's such a complex little scandal, isn't it?</p>
<p class="full-script">And it all goes away if Harvey Dublin is dead.</p>
<p class="full-script">I am a named codefendant in one of the Brixham Lake lawsuits.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, I saw that. Very interesting.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, obviously you're innocent, but, uh, I imagine that there's a lot of stuff that you would rather remain secret that will come out if the suit goes to trial.</p>
<p class="full-script">You had ample motive.</p>
<p class="full-script">So <em>that's</em> option two?</p>
<p class="full-script">Me? I'm your suspect?</p>
<p class="full-script">Wha— (Chuckles)</p>
<p class="full-script">What are you playing at?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, I w— I was just wondering why you didn't tell us this guy was such a sleazebag and that you are up to your neck in his grubby business. That's enough.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, it is. I don't have time for this.</p>
<p class="full-script">You shall just have to trust in my innocence, Mr. Jane.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not good at trust.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm really trying to allow you the latitude that your rare talents deserve, but you make it very difficult.</p>
<p class="full-script">You two may go now. Hightower, stay.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="full-script">What the hell was that?</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you insane?</p>
<p class="full-script">And where did you come up with that stupid-ass diamond story?</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't know what came over me. I see that man, I get an immediate urge to wind him up.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's the director.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm sorry. He amuses me. I'm glad he entertains you, because he's gonna fire you now probably.</p>
<p class="full-script">No. You guys need me too much.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Speaks inaudibly)</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll catch up.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Speaks indistinctly)</p>
<p class="full-script">Excuse me?</p>
<p class="full-script">What did you tell her?</p>
<p class="full-script">I was complimenting her on her Jacket.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's such a vivid color. Liar.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're gonna call <em>me</em> a liar?</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, I hate you. Oh.</p>
<p class="full-script">I do. Mnh-mnh.</p>
<p class="full-script">We have our best people on this thing 24/7.</p>
<p class="full-script">I want to extend my sympathies to the family of Peter Russo, and—and please join us in our prayers for Mr. Dublin's safety.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are there questions— briefly, please?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah. Are you looking into this being a sex-related crime maybe?</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, that alleyway is— no, there's no s*x angle, Jeff— none that we're aware of.</p>
<p class="full-script">Sir, do you think there's a Brixham Lake connection here?</p>
<p class="full-script">No. I don't think so. But both you and Dublin are involved in that case, aren't you?</p>
<p class="full-script">No, no, no. Wh-what we're thinking is, it seems that Mr. Dublin was rumored to keep a large diamond with him, on—on his person, and the theft of that diamond is our current line of thinking as to motive.</p>
<p class="full-script"><em>(Jeff) Yeah? What kind of diamond is it?</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, big. It's 2 or 3 carats, I think.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Scoffs) Why would he carry a diamond like that around with him? Well, that's a good question, Jeff.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, perhaps Mr. Dublin was trying to be prepared for any circumstance.</p>

<p class="full-script">(Turns TV on)</p>

<p class="full-script">How do you think the director is going to feel when he finds out you fooled him into talking complete garbage on TV?</p>
<p class="full-script">It's not garbage, and he'll be very angry or very happy, depending on whether I'm right or not.</p>
<p class="full-script">Right about what?</p>
<p class="full-script">There is no diamond— oh. I see. A trap. Very clever.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mm. A trap for who?</p>
<p class="full-script">Guess. Just tell me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Guess. You know what? Screw you. You crossed a line already, and now you're playing guessing games with me?</p>
<p class="full-script">No, it's just that I'm not sure myself.</p>
<p class="full-script">I have a plan, though. Oh, sheepdip.</p>
<p class="full-script">You are still trying to punish me for lying to you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, you know what?</p>

<p class="full-script">Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Um, now you told me that you and your father talked about everything together, yeah?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes. Did you ever talk about his work?</p>
<p class="full-script">Sometimes. But he never mentioned a diamond, if that's what you're talking about.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thediamond?</p>
<p class="full-script">It said on the news they were looking for a diamond Mr. Dublin had with him.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, yeah, that's— that's just all talk. See? I told you.</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, there's a diamond all right. So I hear, anyhow.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, Dublin keeps it hidden in his false tooth apparently, but nobody knew about it, so I can't see how anybody could've been going after it. No.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, I think this is all connected to a court case.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did your dad ever mention Brixham Lake?</p>

<p class="full-script">So we had a big conversation about the rules, and—and things got a little heated, you know, as they do.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sighs)</p>
<p class="full-script">Look, I felt that she was over-the-line rude to her mother and me, and I slapped her.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not proud of it.</p>
<p class="full-script">But I-it was a tap.</p>
<p class="full-script">Really.</p>
<p class="full-script">It was no big deal.</p>
<p class="full-script">Anyway, Nadine told Pete about it.</p>
<p class="full-script">He got mad.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sighs)</p>
<p class="full-script">Pete and I were buddies.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, we could've had a beer and a discussion, and we could've worked it out.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, but he comes into my house...</p>
<p class="full-script">(Keith) And I don't even have <em>a chance to defend myself!</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, he sucker punches me, </em> and he beat me up badly...</p>
<p class="full-script">In front of my wife and my stepdaughter.</p>
<p class="full-script">Put his foot on my neck, and he spat on me...</p>
<p class="full-script">In my own house!</p>
<p class="full-script">That's not right.</p>
<p class="full-script">Even afterwards, I-it's like I'm the one to blame. No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Patricia insisted that we make peace for Nadine's sake.</p>
<p class="full-script">He does that to me, and I'm supposed to just swallow it?</p>
<p class="full-script">Nobody would.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, I thought about ways to pay him back.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, I thought about it a lot.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Inhales and exhales deeply)</p>
<p class="full-script">But I knew that if I killed him...</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sighs)</p>
<p class="full-script">Patricia would guess that it was me.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Clicks tongue)</p>
<p class="full-script">Unless I could make his death look like it was just...</p>
<p class="full-script">A tragic accident.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sighs)</p>
<p class="full-script"><strong>Patrick</strong>: Sugar?</p>
<p class="full-script">No, thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay. There you go. Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">My pleasure.</p>
<p class="full-script">We're very sorry things worked out this way.</p>
<p class="full-script">You said you'd find out who did it, and you did.</p>
<p class="full-script">(Sighs)</p>
<p class="full-script">How did you know?</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, well, I-I kinda knew from the first moment I met you and Keith.</p>
<p class="full-script">Those little round glasses with the muscles— it just didn't seem to match. Um, indicated a deeply conflicted personality, a lot of anger and frustration.</p>
<p class="full-script">Probably uses those, um, wrist-strengthening things, right?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, um, never a good sign in a man over 20.</p>
<p class="full-script">Obsessive, arrogant, painstaking, uh, secretive, self-righteous. Yeah.</p>
<p class="full-script">I could go on.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah.</p>
<p class="full-script">Men, huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">Eh.</p>
<p class="full-script">Knew the whole time and kept it to yourself, eh?</p>
<p class="full-script">No. No. I only knew when I read the ransom demand, to be honest, but you lied to me, so fair's fair.</p>
<p class="full-script">I promise, I will never lie to you again. I—</p>
<p class="full-script">I lied this one time, because I'm concerned.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're isolating yourself.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're pulling away from us, from me and the unit. Meh.</p>
<p class="full-script">You are. No.</p>
<p class="full-script">You are. It's not good. Wh-what's going on?</p>
<p class="full-script">Anybody that gets close to me— bad things happen to them.</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot;A, &quot; that's not true, and &quot;Bb, &quot; even if it were, I'm a cop.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's our job to be in harm's way. You're not listening to me.</p>
<p class="full-script">We're family. What you're doing is a kind of betrayal. Oh.</p>
<p class="full-script">A surrender. A defeat. You're letting Red John win.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, please. Please. Really?</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay. Enough. All right.</p>
<p class="full-script">No—no more pulling away. All right? Here, give me a hug.</p>
<p class="full-script">You don't mean it. I can tell.</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you mean, you can tell? You can't tell.</p>
<p class="full-script">I <em>don't</em> mean it, but you can't tell that I don't.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're guessing. Yes, I can tell.</p>
<p class="full-script">How?</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't know. I can tell when you're lying now.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, you can't tell. I-I can, too.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's nonsense. You're lying. Liar, liar, pants on fire.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not lying. You are.</p>
