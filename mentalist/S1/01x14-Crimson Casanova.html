<p class="full-script">We've got Claire Wolcott... female, Caucasian, 32 years old.</p>
<p class="full-script">She was found shot to death in her room.</p>
<p class="full-script">Her husband's got friends at the Governor's office, so he called in some favors.</p>
<p class="full-script">He wants the investigation to be kept discreet and low-key.</p>
<p class="full-script">His wife gets murdered and his priority is discretion?</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh. Okay.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yep, Mrs. Wolcott was cheating on Mr. Wolcott...</p>
<p class="full-script">Which makes Mr. Wolcott suspect number one.</p>
<p class="full-script">Number two. Number one would be Mrs. Wolcott's mystery lover.</p>
<p class="full-script">The room was registered in Claire Wolcott's name, so no help there.</p>
<p class="full-script">At 2:24 a.m., hotel staff and guests heard three gunshots, but they didn't know where they were coming from.</p>
<p class="full-script">15, 20 minutes later, they come here and call 911.</p>
<p class="full-script">Whoa. Found a shell.</p>
<p class="full-script">Looks like a 9-millimeter.</p>
<p class="full-script">And another.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mark 'em for forensics.</p>
<p class="full-script">So the lover didn't do it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Because?</p>
<p class="full-script">The, uh, shell casing things indicate the shooter was across the room here.</p>
<p class="full-script">He or she stepped in from outside and started blasting away.</p>
<p class="full-script">If the lover had done it, he'd have been closer to the victim, and he wouldn't have had to shoot as many times.</p>
<p class="full-script">And look. Circular, which means a vertical drip from someone standing right here, bleeding. Right?</p>
<p class="full-script">Not spatter from the victim.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're a forensics expert now?</p>
<p class="full-script">So Claire and mystery lover are asleep.</p>
<p class="full-script">Someone comes in through the open door, shoots them, leaves. Poor lover is woken by a bullet, Claire dead next to him. &quot;Aah!&quot; Freaks out.</p>
<p class="full-script">But nobody comes right away.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mystery lover, who is only slightly wounded, gets to thinking maybe the best thing to do is just... slip away, out here.</p>
<p class="full-script">You two finish up here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, boss.</p>
<p class="full-script">Here.</p>
<p class="full-script">There you go.</p>
<p class="full-script">Clean one.</p>
<p class="full-script">Anything else?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot;Doc lady.&quot;</p>
<p class="full-script">The silver caddy arrived last night at 2:31.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ah. That's about seven and a half minutes after the shooting took place.</p>
<p class="full-script">Name and room number?</p>
<p class="full-script">Open it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Psst.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey. Wake up.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, my god. Who are you?</p>
<p class="full-script">It's all right, ma'am. We're CBI.</p>
<p class="full-script">We need to talk to you, sir.</p>
<p class="full-script">What's this about?</p>
<p class="full-script">Take a wild guess.</p>
<p class="full-script">Put your hands in the air.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay. I'm, uh, I'm not under arrest, am I?</p>
<p class="full-script">'Cause I've done nothing wrong.</p>
<p class="full-script">Pants on. We'll talk after.</p>
<p class="full-script">This is Kevin Haightly, resort manager.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hi. Um, I know we can't expect to get the room back, but when might the walkway be open for use, do you think?</p>
<p class="full-script">That depends on when forensics is done. We'll let you know.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p class="full-script">It was a cold night, so we lit a fire and made love.</p>
<p class="full-script">We went to sleep afterwards, and suddenly there was, like, a sharp pain and bang! I wake up, and there's blood everywhere and I'm shot in the arm and Claire's dead. You know, I freaked.</p>
<p class="full-script">You didn't see who did it?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why'd you leave?</p>
<p class="full-script">Claire was dead. I couldn't help her, and I couldn't help you guys. I didn't see anything, so...</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, what could I contribute?</p>
<p class="full-script">She's a married woman.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, we know that. And Jill Rubenstein... what's your connection with her?</p>
<p class="full-script">The doctor lady?</p>
<p class="full-script">I met her in the parking lot and asked her for help.</p>
<p class="full-script">A complete stranger takes you to her room, treats your wound and then has sexual intercourse with you?</p>
<p class="full-script">What can I say? The hippocratic oath is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p class="full-script">How well did you know Claire Wolcott?</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, I don't really know her that well.</p>
<p class="full-script">I met her just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="full-script">She was at a bar, and I picked her up.</p>
<p class="full-script">Since then, I've seen her occasionally for s*x.</p>
<p class="full-script">Is that what happened last night?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah. I called and asked her to meet me for a drink.</p>
<p class="full-script">We came here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did anybody else know you were here?</p>
<p class="full-script">Nobody. Just me and Claire.</p>
<p class="full-script">And how long had you been in the room?</p>
<p class="full-script">Um, a few hours.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'd agreed to, uh, you know, stay the night.</p>
<p class="full-script">I was fond of Claire, and it's a long drive home, so I stayed.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't normally do that.</p>
<p class="full-script">No? What... what's your normal procedure?</p>
<p class="full-script">After lovemaking? Depends on the type of woman.</p>
<p class="full-script">So you've got it down to a science.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm good at what I do.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, Mr. Fricke, and what is it that you do?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm a pickup artist.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mm.</p>
<p class="full-script">A, uh, woman whisperer, if you will.</p>
<p class="full-script">A pickup artist... that's your profession?</p>
<p class="full-script">You sound like my mom.</p>
<p class="full-script">Um, it's more of a total lifestyle kind of thing.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know? I-I practice my art, of course. That's my passion.</p>
<p class="full-script">But I teach and I blog also, um, conduct seminars, workshops, that sort of thing.</p>
<p class="full-script">Is that good money?</p>
<p class="full-script">Not bad.</p>
<p class="full-script">And do you take money from the women you pick up?</p>
<p class="full-script">Sometimes, when I need to.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did you take money from Claire Wolcott?</p>
<p class="full-script">No. No. Like I say, I was fond of Claire.</p>
<p class="full-script">Um, I planned to see her again.</p>
<p class="full-script">You really only want to monetize as an exit strategy.</p>
<p class="full-script">Paul, is your mother still alive?</p>
<p class="full-script">I know where you're going with this, Dr. Freud, And, uh, you're wrong.</p>
<p class="full-script">My mom's dead, as it goes, but, uh, I loved her dearly, and she loved me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who said anything about your mother?</p>
<p class="full-script">You just did.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, you did.</p>
<p class="full-script">Didn't.</p>
<p class="full-script">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm just kidding. Just playing with you, Paul.</p>
<p class="full-script">Just kidding, mucking around.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah. Are we done here?</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you know who killed Claire?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Interesting.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's either a habitual liar telling the truth or he's an honest man lying.</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you keep a list of your pickups?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, of course. I, uh, I have 'em here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Names, numbers and a 1 to 10 grading system.</p>
<p class="full-script">Nice. Something to show your grandkids.</p>
<p class="full-script">We're gonna need you to forward a copy of that list to us.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh. Yeah, sure.</p>
<p class="full-script">What, you think maybe this was a jealous ex-lover?</p>
<p class="full-script">Could be.</p>
<p class="full-script">Wow.</p>
<p class="full-script">I say we bring him in anyway, for creepiness.</p>
<p class="full-script">Which should be a criminal offense, but isn't.</p>
<p class="full-script">He could have shot her, then shot himself to cover it up.</p>
<p class="full-script">He simply could have shot her and left.</p>
<p class="full-script">He didn't have the gun on him, local P.D. has searched every inch of this place and found nothing. He's clean.</p>
<p class="full-script">Maybe someone's trying to kill him, not her.</p>
<p class="full-script">Not likely. The room was registered in Claire Wolcott's name. No one else knew he was there.</p>
<p class="full-script">What was she thinking?</p>
<p class="full-script">She was so beautiful, and he's so... creepy.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, that Dr. Rubenstein was hot, too. How does he do it?</p>
<p class="full-script">All you need is a basic understanding of the evolutionary psychology of women, rigorously and fearlessly applied.</p>
<p class="full-script">You gotta know what buttons to press.</p>
<p class="full-script">Like we're toasters?</p>
<p class="full-script">Like men don't have buttons, too?</p>
<p class="full-script">Men are like toasters.</p>
<p class="full-script">Women... a little more like, uh, accordions.</p>
<p class="full-script">I thought that was a compliment.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mr. Wolcott?</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you for coming. I'm so sorry for your loss.</p>
<p class="full-script">The effects you requested... photos, video of Claire.</p>
<p class="full-script">We'll return this to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="full-script">I was just upstairs speaking with my friend the Attorney General, And I told him that I will not rest Until the man who did this is brought to justice.</p>
<p class="full-script">I will not rest.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know I can expect the same from you and your people.</p>
<p class="full-script">I assure you This unit does the best we can with every case we run. Cho?</p>
<p class="full-script">If it's convenient, Agent Cho would like to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hi.</p>
<p class="full-script">When did you speak to your wife last?</p>
<p class="full-script">I was in San Francisco on a business dinner.</p>
<p class="full-script">I called Claire around midday, Told her I'll probably be staying in town that night.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did you? Stay the night in town?</p>
<p class="full-script">I did.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did she say where she was going or who she was meeting?</p>
<p class="full-script">No, but I didn't ask.</p>
<p class="full-script">So you didn't know she was at the spa?</p>
<p class="full-script">I wouldn't expect to know.</p>
<p class="full-script">She often went up there on a whim.</p>
<p class="full-script">Can you think of anyone who want to hurt her?</p>
<p class="full-script">No. No, she was, um... Harmless.</p>
<p class="full-script">Any friends or family that might be in any trouble?</p>
<p class="full-script">She's from back east.</p>
<p class="full-script">She doesn't have any family or friends out here.</p>
<p class="full-script">She shopped and she played tennis and she went to the spas.</p>
<p class="full-script">No one would have any motives...</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes?</p>
<p class="full-script">I recall she fired an assistant last month.</p>
<p class="full-script">Caught her stealing jewelry.</p>
<p class="full-script">I believe she was pressing charges.</p>
<p class="full-script">Name?</p>
<p class="full-script">Natalie... Something. My people will have her details.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you aware that on the night of her murder, Your wife was meeting a lover?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">The local authorities told me they suspected as much.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did you know she had a lover? Prior to her death, I mean?</p>
<p class="full-script">No. Do you have a name? is he a suspect?</p>
<p class="full-script">We have a name. He is not the suspect.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who is he?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not at liberty to say.</p>
<p class="full-script">I want his name.</p>
<p class="full-script">You can't have it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you sure, Agent Cho?</p>
<p class="full-script">Because I can make one phone call, And your career is toast.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's impressive.</p>
<p class="full-script">The best I can get with one call is a pizza.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now this business dinner you were at in San Francisco, What's the timing on that, and who else was there?</p>
<p class="full-script">My people can give you times, names and numbers.</p>
<p class="full-script">We're done here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thanks for your cooperation.</p>
<p class="full-script">Wolcott's wife was so pretty.</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you see?</p>
<p class="full-script">Nice shoes, loneliness.</p>
<p class="full-script">Where we going?</p>
<p class="full-script">Natalie Edreau?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes?</p>
<p class="full-script">We're with the CBI. Can we come in?</p>
<p class="full-script">Look, I already told the cops I didn't steal anything from that bitch.</p>
<p class="full-script">By &quot;bitch,&quot; are you referring Claire Wolcott?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah. So?</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh...</p>
<p class="full-script">She was murdered last night.</p>
<p class="full-script">How long did you work for Claire Wolcott?</p>
<p class="full-script">About a year... Till she turned psycho.</p>
<p class="full-script">She claimed that you stole jewelry from her.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah. She was wrong. I didn't steal anything.</p>
<p class="full-script">Claire pressed charges against you.</p>
<p class="full-script">How'd that make you feel?</p>
<p class="full-script">Excuse me, are you trying to say that I killed her?</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you own a gun, Natalie?</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, my god. This is really stupid.</p>
<p class="full-script">Um, no, I don't own a gun. And, no, I didn't kill Claire.</p>
<p class="full-script">Where were you last night?</p>
<p class="full-script">I was hanging out with my roommate till about 9:00 or so.</p>
<p class="full-script">Then, uh, then I went out for dinner.</p>
<p class="full-script">What'd you have? For dinner?</p>
<p class="full-script">What does that have to do with anything?</p>
<p class="full-script">The chopped salad at pastucci's.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ah. Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">There's something on this side of the room You don't want us to find. What is that?</p>
<p class="full-script">Nothing. There's nothing.</p>
<p class="full-script">Look me in the eye and say that.</p>
<p class="full-script">Whatever. Search all you want.</p>
<p class="full-script">Meh. Too much stuff. You're not very tidy.</p>
<p class="full-script">Good in bed I expect, yeah?</p>
<p class="full-script">Messy women make good lovers.</p>
<p class="full-script">Can I hold your hand?</p>
<p class="full-script">I...</p>
<p class="full-script">Shush.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hmm...</p>
<p class="full-script">Camera.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, those are personal, so...</p>
<p class="full-script">ooh.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh-huh.</p>
<p class="full-script">Is it...</p>
<p class="full-script">Claire Wolcott and her lover Paul Fricke...</p>
<p class="full-script">Time-stamped two hours before the murder.</p>
<p class="full-script">These are the photos we pulled from your digital camera.</p>
<p class="full-script">A couple hours after these were taken, Claire Wolcott was dead.</p>
<p class="full-script">That doesn't prove anything.</p>
<p class="full-script">Opportunity and motive. You were close by when she died.</p>
<p class="full-script">And the theft charge she laid on you dies with her.</p>
<p class="full-script">That was a garbage charge.</p>
<p class="full-script">I wasn't worried about that.</p>
<p class="full-script">No?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">You didn't steal jewelry from her?</p>
<p class="full-script">Please. She dressed like a mormon call girl.</p>
<p class="full-script">I wouldn't want her jewelry if you paid me.</p>
<p class="full-script">I didn't ask if you want her jewelry.</p>
<p class="full-script">I asked if you stole it.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why were you photographing her?</p>
<p class="full-script">Now think this through, Natalie. We're investigating murder.</p>
<p class="full-script">If you have an explanation for these That doesn't involve killing her, You should tell us, get yourself off the hook.</p>
<p class="full-script">I thought If I threatened to tell her husband about the affair, Then she would drop the theft charges.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's what the pictures are for.</p>
<p class="full-script">How do you know she is having affair?</p>
<p class="full-script">It was obvious. She kept sending me out to buy men's gifts.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, like, watches and ties.</p>
<p class="full-script">I knew it wasn't for her husband. I'm not an idiot.</p>
<p class="full-script">What did Claire say when you confronted her about it?</p>
<p class="full-script">I didn't confront her about it.</p>
<p class="full-script">She left with that flugly guy before I got the chance.</p>
<p class="full-script">Probably wouldn't have worked anyway.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why not?</p>
<p class="full-script">Because keith Wolcott is, like, super controlling, Especially about money.</p>
<p class="full-script">He probably knew all along his wife was sleeping around.</p>
<p class="full-script">What's the verdict?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not liking her for this.</p>
<p class="full-script">But we should talk to the roommate, Make sure her alibi stands up.</p>
<p class="full-script">The husband, on the other hand...</p>
<p class="full-script">He is the type to know about his wife's affairs.</p>
<p class="full-script">His business dinner at San Francisco Couldn't have made it back to calistoga to kill her.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's also the type That'll hire other people to do his dirty work.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes. He is.</p>
<p class="full-script">And they don't take credit cards.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll look into his finances.</p>
<p class="full-script">Boring.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, Mr. Entertainment. What do you want to do?</p>
<p class="full-script">I wanna go back to the crime scene.</p>
<p class="full-script">That hotel room... there is something that just isn't right.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're up.</p>
<p class="full-script">Great.</p>
<p class="full-script">Something's not quite right.</p>
<p class="full-script">Don't take too long. I'm hungry.</p>
<p class="full-script">Let's go eat.</p>
<p class="full-script">Good to see you again. So... Is there any news?</p>
<p class="full-script">The owner keeps asking me When we'll be able to reopen the villa.</p>
<p class="full-script">No news.</p>
<p class="full-script">We're here for lunch.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh. Absolutely. Um...</p>
<p class="full-script">One moment.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, look who's here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ah, just the man.</p>
<p class="full-script">I have a question I need to ask him.</p>
<p class="full-script">Right this way.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh. Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Katie?</p>
<p class="full-script">Table four needs fresh drinks, okay?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey!</p>
<p class="full-script">My old friends from the CBI. Come, have a seat.</p>
<p class="full-script">Surprised to see you back here so soon.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's my number one hunting ground, Loaded with my kind of women...</p>
<p class="full-script">Beautiful, rich, married and unhappy.</p>
<p class="full-script">So you specialize?</p>
<p class="full-script">Sure. Yeah.</p>
<p class="full-script">Some guys will tell ya hot, young singles are the real test.</p>
<p class="full-script">But I'm not in this to win a points contest, you know?</p>
<p class="full-script">Plus, I like the gratitude you get from the older ladies.</p>
<p class="full-script">A woman died... a woman that you were close to.</p>
<p class="full-script">Doesn't that give you pause?</p>
<p class="full-script">Sure it does. Yeah, I have feelings.</p>
<p class="full-script">But having this gunshot wound?</p>
<p class="full-script">Genius opener.</p>
<p class="full-script">An opener?</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, a prop or a line you use to start a conversation.</p>
<p class="full-script">You can't just go up and say, &quot;hey, what's your name? &quot; - No?</p>
<p class="full-script">Duh.</p>
<p class="full-script">So how do you do it exactly? You know, pick up women.</p>
<p class="full-script">Need some help, huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Big handsome dude like you? I got a few basic techniques... that will turn you into a freakin' s*x machine.</p>
<p class="full-script">A machine.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, I'm not looking to be a machine so much.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm more of a steady relationship kind of guy.</p>
<p class="full-script">When you're scoring... with a different super fox every night, what do you want a relationship for?</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you ever fall in love... with any of these different super foxes you score with?</p>
<p class="full-script">No. Never.</p>
<p class="full-script">Love is for guys who can't get laid.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh.</p>
<p class="full-script">So, uh, what's your basic technique?</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, there's a thousand ways to seduce a woman.</p>
<p class="full-script">All kinds of workable systems.</p>
<p class="full-script">But they all boil down to three words...</p>
<p class="full-script">... &quot;contempt&quot;, &quot;control&quot;, &quot;excitement&quot;.</p>
<p class="full-script">Contempt, control, e... excitement?</p>
<p class="full-script">Women want men that don't need or want them.</p>
<p class="full-script">They want to be told what to do, ... and they want edge, adventure, drama.</p>
<p class="full-script">Whatever you wanna call it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Present that package to them, and they will bite.</p>
<p class="full-script">Guaranteed.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ouch.</p>
<p class="full-script">And then when you have one under your spell, ... then you get up and leave.</p>
<p class="full-script">L... leave? But...</p>
<p class="full-script">No, no, no, no. You leave. Trust me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Next time she sees you, she'll tear your clothes off.</p>
<p class="full-script">Guaranteed.</p>
<p class="full-script">What's going on with you two?</p>
<p class="full-script">Excuse me?</p>
<p class="full-script">You and Katie here. You got something going on?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Just askin'.</p>
<p class="full-script">I used to let her sleep with me once in a while. That's all.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, you had feelings for her.</p>
<p class="full-script">Years ago, maybe a little. Sure.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, before I got my mojo working.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hmm.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thanks for talking to us, Paul.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, you had one more question... you wanted to ask.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ah, yes, that's right. Thank you. I forgot.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, the night that you were sleeping with Claire, ... was the patio door open or closed?</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh... Closed, I think.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">OK, now I'm really hungry.</p>
<p class="full-script">Drive-thru.</p>
<p class="full-script">Done.</p>
<p class="full-script">You think Fricke's right?</p>
<p class="full-script">Was the door closed? Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">It was a cold night. They lit a fire.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why would they leave the door open?</p>
<p class="full-script">No, I mean, is he right about how to deal with women?</p>
<p class="full-script">100% wrong.</p>
<p class="full-script">Unless, of course, you wanna have a lot of casual s*x...</p>
<p class="full-script">... with total strangers. Then he's right.</p>
<p class="full-script">When did you first meet Paul Fricke?</p>
<p class="full-script">At a wine tasting event a friend was throwing.</p>
<p class="full-script">And how long were you and he romantically involved?</p>
<p class="full-script">Um...</p>
<p class="full-script">Three, maybe four hours.</p>
<p class="full-script">So you didn't know Paul Fricke...</p>
<p class="full-script">... prior to agreeing to spend the night with him?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">And you haven't spoken to him since?</p>
<p class="full-script">What attracted you to him in the first place?</p>
<p class="full-script">Four times?</p>
<p class="full-script">What exactly attracted you to Paul Fricke in the first place?</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't know. I guess there was just something about him.</p>
<p class="full-script">And were you at all hurt or angry...</p>
<p class="full-script">... when the relationship ended?</p>
<p class="full-script">Mm... no. I was disappointed more than anything.</p>
<p class="full-script">We had a wonderful time together.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you for your time.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, you'll, um, you'll tell him &quot;hello&quot; for me, won't you?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, how's it going? Any potential suspects?</p>
<p class="full-script">Nope. I'm bringing in the rest tomorrow.</p>
<p class="full-script">There's more?</p>
<p class="full-script">This is just &quot;A&quot; through &quot;M.&quot; How's it going with you?</p>
<p class="full-script">No unusual transactions for Mr. Wolcott.</p>
<p class="full-script">But three days before she was killed, ... Claire Wolcott made a $200,000 withdrawal...</p>
<p class="full-script">... in the form of a cashier's check, ... made out to none other than Paul Fricke.</p>
<p class="full-script">Here's the best part... according to the bank, Keith Wolcott set up the account, so he'd be notified...</p>
<p class="full-script">... whenever a large transaction took place.</p>
<p class="full-script">Meaning that Wolcott had to have known about the 200 grand.</p>
<p class="full-script">Exactly.</p>
<p class="full-script">Nice work.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thanks.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh... Brandy?</p>
<p class="full-script">Come on.</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot;Darn it, woman!&quot; said the redneck.</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot;Ain't you never seen a goat before? &quot;</p>
<p class="full-script">He's handling his grief well.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mm.</p>
<p class="full-script">Excuse me, Mr. Wolcott?</p>
<p class="full-script">Now's not a good time.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm sorry to intrude.</p>
<p class="full-script">We need to ask you some follow-up questions...</p>
<p class="full-script">... regarding your previous statement.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll be happy to speak with you tomorrow morning in my office.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, this won't take long.</p>
<p class="full-script">I told you... tomorrow morning, my office.</p>
<p class="full-script">Very good.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mr. Wolcott, it's about your wife's lover.</p>
<p class="full-script">We, uh, know about the $200,000 she gave him, And we know that you know about it.</p>
<p class="full-script">How dare you.</p>
<p class="full-script">How dare I? Did I do something daring?</p>
<p class="full-script">Am I supposed to be afraid of you?</p>
<p class="full-script">You're supposed to be respectful.</p>
<p class="full-script">Respectful? You contemptible little buffoon.</p>
<p class="full-script">Your wife just died, ... and you're swanning around in a monkey suit...</p>
<p class="full-script">... drinking punch and laughing with your idiot friends...</p>
<p class="full-script">And you want respect?</p>
<p class="full-script">There's your respect.</p>
<p class="full-script">What?</p>
<p class="full-script">You know damn well what. You assaulted a man.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, I just tweaked him on the nose.</p>
<p class="full-script">Technically, that's assault.</p>
<p class="full-script">Technically, he's an ass. He deserved it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, he is, but this is not a school yard.</p>
<p class="full-script">You simply cannot do stuff like that.</p>
<p class="full-script">I did. I did it.</p>
<p class="full-script">And the seas didn't boil and the sky didn't fall.</p>
<p class="full-script">They will shortly.</p>
<p class="full-script">Wolcott is on his way down here with a $1,000-an-hour lawyer.</p>
<p class="full-script">If you give him a formal apology, ... he says he's willing to drop the whole matter.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hmm, let me think... No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Would you please be reasonable for once?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm busy.</p>
<p class="full-script">Right.</p>
<p class="full-script">I am. I'm just thinking that, uh...</p>
<p class="full-script">He's gonna drop the whole matter in any case.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, really?</p>
<p class="full-script">I guarantee it.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's a shallow narcissist. It's all about image.</p>
<p class="full-script">And this whole business makes him seem small and silly.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ooh!</p>
<p class="full-script">Contempt, control, excitement.</p>
<p class="full-script">What?</p>
<p class="full-script">Nothing.</p>
<p class="full-script">This place is so nice.</p>
<p class="full-script">$800 a night, minimum. Can you believe that?</p>
<p class="full-script">Huh.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hello? What, you're not talking to me now?</p>
<p class="full-script">You barely said a word the whole time.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll talk to you when you have something interesting to say.</p>
<p class="full-script">Fine. Be a jerk.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'd go in. But I'd have to keep my injury dry.</p>
<p class="full-script">Gunshot wound.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh.</p>
<p class="full-script">Don't worry. Uh, you're not in any danger.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm a lover, not a fighter.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, not you guys again.</p>
<p class="full-script">The old magic not working so good today, huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">Just like baseball.</p>
<p class="full-script">Most of the time, even in major leagues, You, uh, swing and you miss. Gotta keep on swinging.</p>
<p class="full-script">I hit on ten women a day.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm going to have sexual intercourse...</p>
<p class="full-script">... with at least one of them.</p>
<p class="full-script">That is gross.</p>
<p class="full-script">She's intrigued by me, this one.</p>
<p class="full-script">She's just too proud to admit it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, get your shoes on, Romeo.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey.</p>
<p class="full-script">Focus on the shoes.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, I didn't notice before.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're not bad lookin'.</p>
<p class="full-script">Shoulders are a bit too wide, but, uh, otherwise, pretty nice.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're kidding, right? You're trying to hit on me?</p>
<p class="full-script">What man in his right mind wouldn't want to hit on you?</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, leave her alone.</p>
<p class="full-script">Get in the car.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">My colleague, Agent Jane, refuses to apologize.</p>
<p class="full-script">He says he's happy to see you in court.</p>
<p class="full-script">And you refuse to talk to us, so I can't rule you out as a suspect.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm afraid this is gonna make a bit of a mess.</p>
<p class="full-script">Keith, I suggest...</p>
<p class="full-script">No, no. I have nothing to hide.</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you wanna know?</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you know about your wife's affair with Paul Fricke?</p>
<p class="full-script">I knew Claire was having an affair with this Fricke person, and I knew about the money she was gonna give him.</p>
<p class="full-script">Then why did you deny it?</p>
<p class="full-script">It's not the sort of thing one likes to admit, now, is it?</p>
<p class="full-script">And I knew it would make me a suspect, and that would be tedious.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did you confront her about Fricke?</p>
<p class="full-script">No. I stopped the check immediately, of course.</p>
<p class="full-script">And that was the end of it? You weren't angry?</p>
<p class="full-script">Not at all. I was happy.</p>
<p class="full-script">I wanted to divorce her for ages.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why?</p>
<p class="full-script">She'd become irritating.</p>
<p class="full-script">The cost of divorce always deterred me, but her infidelity with Fricke cut the payout she'd receive in half.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now if Claire had lived, come Monday, She'd be in for a nasty surprise.</p>
<p class="full-script">I was all set to serve her with divorce papers.</p>
<p class="full-script">Even cuckolded, she stood to get a big sum.</p>
<p class="full-script">Rich man like yourself... her death saved you a lot of money, didn't it?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, it did.</p>
<p class="full-script">But money isn't everything, is it?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm sorry she's dead... truly sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">But every cloud... as they say.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, I believe we're done here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Seems so.</p>
<p class="full-script">You'll be hearing from the attorney general shortly regarding Mr. Jane's conduct.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, I doubt it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Really?</p>
<p class="full-script">When you've thought about it, you'll see that this business makes you seem small and silly, and you'll drop the whole matter.</p>
<p class="full-script">You misled us, Paul.</p>
<p class="full-script">You were going to take money from Claire.</p>
<p class="full-script">But I didn't, did I?</p>
<p class="full-script">A business associate of mine is opening up a new club here in town.</p>
<p class="full-script">He, uh, offered me a role as partial owner if I could come up with a share of the building costs.</p>
<p class="full-script">Claire was generous enough to offer me a loan.</p>
<p class="full-script">And?</p>
<p class="full-script">I went to deposit it just a couple days ago and was told that the check had been stopped.</p>
<p class="full-script">That must have been disappointing.</p>
<p class="full-script">What did Claire say?</p>
<p class="full-script">She said it must be a mistake, and she'd take care of it Monday.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did you believe her?</p>
<p class="full-script">Doesn't really matter.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know what the best part about being me is?</p>
<p class="full-script">No, I don't.</p>
<p class="full-script">There are literally dozens of rich, needy women out there that, uh, I could go to for financial help.</p>
<p class="full-script">I didn't need Claire's money.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, what's the story with Katie the waitress?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm in the middle of something.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh. I'm sorry. I was just thinking.</p>
<p class="full-script">I had a thought. Bear with me?</p>
<p class="full-script">So Katie... tell me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Nothing to tell.</p>
<p class="full-script">Used to be if I, uh, didn't score for whatever reason, I'd, uh, call her off the bench.</p>
<p class="full-script">Can't sleep alone, huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">Some people use cocoa and a good book.</p>
<p class="full-script">I use beautiful women.</p>
<p class="full-script">She must have been crazy about you To put up with a deal like that, huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">I guess so.</p>
<p class="full-script">Difficult for her now to watch you pick up a different beautiful woman every night.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's not how it is with me and Katie.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, sure, it is.</p>
<p class="full-script">She loves you. That much is clear.</p>
<p class="full-script">Maybe that's what this is all about.</p>
<p class="full-script">Your behavior got too much for her.</p>
<p class="full-script">Katie has absolutely nothing to do with this.</p>
<p class="full-script">How can you be so sure?</p>
<p class="full-script">I know Katie. She's a good person.</p>
<p class="full-script">She would never hurt anyone.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, great.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thanks. You can go.</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ah, sorry. I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">When agent Cho says you can go, you can go. Not a moment sooner.</p>
<p class="full-script">Just give me one second.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, you can't dismiss my subjects like that.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, I know, and I took it back.</p>
<p class="full-script">Besides, we need him back out there in the saddle.</p>
<p class="full-script">You will agree with me 100% when I explain my theory, my little plan.</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you have any good clothes?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm wearing them.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, do you have anything with a little more, uh... zing?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well...</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm gonna have to take you shopping, Just you and me.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll wait for you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Right here.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm in position.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, look around for a likely target.</p>
<p class="full-script">Will do. Hey...</p>
<p class="full-script">Bourbon on the rocks. Make it a double.</p>
<p class="full-script">Those two will do, I guess.</p>
<p class="full-script">Good.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, now listen up.</p>
<p class="full-script">Relax. I'm gonna talk you right through this.</p>
<p class="full-script">Keep it smooth. You have to be calm and confident.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, you told me that already. I have the general idea.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hello, ladies, I'll be right with you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Start a tab for me, would you? Room 206. That's for you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hi. My name's Kimball. What are your names? You first.</p>
<p class="full-script">Darby...</p>
<p class="full-script">Darby.</p>
<p class="full-script">Sarabeth.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, Sarabeth. Tell me about yourselves.</p>
<p class="full-script">Um...</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you wanna know?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, it's not exactly textbook, but he's figuring it out.</p>
<p class="full-script">That worked? &quot;hello, ladies&quot;?</p>
<p class="full-script">He's kicking it old-school.</p>
<p class="full-script">There's Fricke.</p>
<p class="full-script">Where?</p>
<p class="full-script">Let me see.</p>
<p class="full-script">Cho, look, with the two blondes.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't believe this guy.</p>
<p class="full-script">I give up. I do not understand women.</p>
<p class="full-script">Never have, never will.</p>
<p class="full-script">Seems like the dumber you treat them, the better they like it.</p>
<p class="full-script">They're Drunk Women.</p>
<p class="full-script">You can't generalize all women in general.</p>
<p class="full-script">This is your fault.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, it's not. I'm just sitting here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Katie? You've worked a double today.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why don't you clock out and have a drink on the house?</p>
<p class="full-script">Thanks, Mr.H. That'd be good.</p>
<p class="full-script">Sure.</p>
<p class="full-script">Here we go.</p>
<p class="full-script">This is where we bring it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Time for phase two.</p>
<p class="full-script">Roger that. Phase two coming up.</p>
<p class="full-script">What's phase two?</p>
<p class="full-script">Let's go, Sarabeth.</p>
<p class="full-script">What did he say?</p>
<p class="full-script">What did he say?</p>
<p class="full-script">I didn't hear.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, he said, uh...</p>
<p class="full-script">You don't wanna know.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, well.</p>
<p class="full-script">Struck out, huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">I blew it, as usual.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm just unlucky in love. Always have been.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know how that goes.</p>
<p class="full-script">Same story, huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">Same story.</p>
<p class="full-script">That guy?</p>
<p class="full-script">Him.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know, no offense, but I've been watching him Operate this evening, and he seems like kind of a creep.</p>
<p class="full-script">A player, no doubt, but a creep.</p>
<p class="full-script">This isn't who he is.</p>
<p class="full-script">When we were together, He was a sweet, caring, generous man.</p>
<p class="full-script">It was me that screwed it up.</p>
<p class="full-script">And we had this terrible fight, And I said some mean things.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mean things.</p>
<p class="full-script">All this is an attempt to prove me wrong, I guess.</p>
<p class="full-script">If I had a woman like you in love with me, You could say whatever you like. I wouldn't be running around.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's nice of you to say. Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know what we need to do?</p>
<p class="full-script">You need to make him jealous. Let him see you out and about, Enjoying yourself with another man.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you hitting on me?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's a good plan, isn't it?</p>
<p class="full-script">The kid's a natural. Look at him. Look at him go.</p>
<p class="full-script">The Cho. No business like Cho business.</p>
<p class="full-script">206.</p>
<p class="full-script">Here's the plan. Let's walk right past him, Laughing and smiling like we're on our way somewhere cool.</p>
<p class="full-script">Get him thinking.</p>
<p class="full-script">And then what?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll think of something.</p>
<p class="full-script">All right. Let's do it.</p>
<p class="full-script">After you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, we're in the room.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, Cho, that's some nice work.</p>
<p class="full-script">Very nice work. So just sit tight.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't think it's gonna take long.</p>
<p class="full-script">You hope.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who are you talking to?</p>
<p class="full-script">My colleagues.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay. Who are they?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm a state agent, Ma'am.</p>
<p class="full-script">We're conducting an undercover operation Regarding the wolcott murder case.</p>
<p class="full-script">I... I don't understand.</p>
<p class="full-script">I apologize for the deception.</p>
<p class="full-script">You mean... You're not... You don't...</p>
<p class="full-script">No, Ma'am.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm so embarrassed.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's understandable.</p>
<p class="full-script">I...</p>
<p class="full-script">Nothing is happening.</p>
<p class="full-script">You have to have patience, woman.</p>
<p class="full-script">She just doesn't have any patience.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not touching that one.</p>
<p class="full-script">There.</p>
<p class="full-script">Come on.</p>
<p class="full-script">Drop the weapon.</p>
<p class="full-script">Drop it, Haightly.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hands behind your back. Let's go.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hi.</p>
<p class="full-script">You set me up.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, we did.</p>
<p class="full-script">How did you know it was me?</p>
<p class="full-script">Ah. It was a cold night.</p>
<p class="full-script">Fricke told us that the patio door in his room was closed when he went to sleep, and I checked. You can't open them from the outside, which means that the killer must have entered by the main door, which requires a key.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who has the keys? Staff.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who on the staff would wanna hurt Claire Wolcott?</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't know. Nobody.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who would wanna hurt Paul Fricke?</p>
<p class="full-script">Maybe you.</p>
<p class="full-script">But what reason would you have for hating Paul Fricke?</p>
<p class="full-script">Let me guess. Uh, something to do with a woman?</p>
<p class="full-script">Katie?</p>
<p class="full-script">You hated him because he used and abused her...</p>
<p class="full-script">The woman you loved.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not sorry. He's dirt.</p>
<p class="full-script">The way he carried on with those other women...</p>
<p class="full-script">Rubbing Katie's nose in it.</p>
<p class="full-script">I never would hurt her like he did.</p>
<p class="full-script">I wish I had killed him.</p>
<p class="full-script">But you killed Claire Wolcott instead.</p>
<p class="full-script">I never meant to do that. I wanted to kill Fricke, Not Claire. But she shouldn't have been doing what she was doing, should she? I mean, it's not like anybody cares.</p>
<p class="full-script">Her husband was going...</p>
<p class="full-script">I care. I care about Claire Wolcott.</p>
<p class="full-script">She was a living person.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's enough.</p>
<p class="full-script">No. You took her life.</p>
<p class="full-script">I...I just... I think he should be sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're right.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, do you wanna say it?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Where's Cho?</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't know.</p>
<p class="full-script">Called him a couple times. No answer.</p>
<p class="full-script">The problem is, I really love Paul.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know how he seems, and I know how he's been, but at the end of the day, when I think of who I really wanna be with, it's him.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's crazy, huh?</p>
