<p class="full-script"><strong>Mentalist</strong> <em>'men-t3-list</em> noun. Someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion. A master manipulator of thoughts and behavior.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you sure about this? What if somebody sees us?</p>
<p class="full-script">Relax, baby. I got it all under control.</p>
<p class="full-script">What do we have here?</p>
<p class="full-script">The name's Harry Lashley, a junior V.P. With the company.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's the son-in-law of the boss, A.P. Caid.</p>
<p class="full-script">The receptionist, Miss Duane, over there, forget her phone.</p>
<p class="full-script">Came back to get it, found him like this.</p>
<p class="full-script">She called security. Luckily I was working late.</p>
<p class="full-script">I called 9-1-1 as soon as I got here.</p>
<p class="full-script">I then opened up Mr. Caid's office to check, but nothing was amiss.</p>
<p class="full-script">I have an all-access pass.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, come on.</p>
<p class="full-script">Only one thing was missing, but it's the most valuable painting he owns.</p>
<p class="full-script">A.p. Picked it up at an auction a couple of months ago.</p>
<p class="full-script">Paid a little over $50 million for it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now you said that these doors were, uh, closed before you got here?</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, the office is always locked up when A.P.'s not here.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's a strict rule that A.P. Has when he's gone.</p>
<p class="full-script">And Mr. Lashley... What would he have been doing here?</p>
<p class="full-script">No idea. His office is two floors down.</p>
<p class="full-script">He had no reason to be here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Maybe he was involved.</p>
<p class="full-script">If we're lucky, we'll find the murder weapon.</p>
<p class="full-script">This was obviously a well-planned robbery.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why is that obvious?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, nobody finds themselves in a locked room full of old masters in the middle of the night by accident, do they?</p>
<p class="full-script">So well-planned, but they weren't expecting to meet any opposition.</p>
<p class="full-script">Otherwise, Mr. Lashley here would have been shot or tasered or tied up and gagged.</p>
<p class="full-script">But when they were surprised by him, they simply hit him on the head, Which suggests an improvised weapon, yeah?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm listening.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, something like...</p>
<p class="full-script">I predict forensics will find traces of Harry Lashley on this bust.</p>
<p class="full-script">No offense, but I used to be police myself, and that's not police work. That's guessing.</p>
<p class="full-script">Carl, bag this for me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes.sir.</p>
<p class="full-script">Frank. Is there a good diner around here?</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, yeah. Garrity's, a couple of blocks over on... Madison.</p>
<p class="full-script">Do they do good eggs?</p>
<p class="full-script">I guess.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's the test of a good diner... Eggs.</p>
<p class="full-script">You must have had a contentious relationship with your father.</p>
<p class="full-script">Excuse me? Uh, no.</p>
<p class="full-script">Tell me... I can't tell with the hair in her face and the sobbing, But, uh, I imagine Miss Duane is quite attractive, isn't she?</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, receptionists are often hired for their looks.</p>
<p class="full-script">What are you talking about?</p>
<p class="full-script">Where are you going with this?</p>
<p class="full-script">This way. Look at the seams.</p>
<p class="full-script">These shoulder seams here... Pulled apart...</p>
<p class="full-script">And the way he's lying so straight like this, and that shoe that has come off.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, we all noticed. Somebody must have dragged him here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, but dragged him from where? And why?</p>
<p class="full-script">Care to tell us, frank?</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p class="full-script">All right, then let me explain.</p>
<p class="full-script">You and Miss Duane came up here to have s*x in the boss' office.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's absurd. Why would I do such a stupid thing?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, because it's forbidden, and thus, very sexy, of course, Especially if you have father issues.</p>
<p class="full-script">And who doesn't?</p>
<p class="full-script">It's a furtive but powerful challenge to the paternal authority.</p>
<p class="full-script">So you open up A.P.'s office and then, &quot;crap. There's a dead body. What are we gonna do? &quot;</p>
<p class="full-script">You gotta report it, but how do you explain your presence in his office?</p>
<p class="full-script">A quick but dirty solution...</p>
<p class="full-script">You drag the body out and lock the doors back up before calling the police.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who is this guy?</p>
<p class="full-script">He's a pain in the ass, but he's making sense.</p>
<p class="full-script">You sure you don't want to change your statement?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, please, frank, it'd be silly to deny it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Five minutes in a room with the persuasive agent cho, And Miss Duane will tell all.</p>
<p class="full-script">Back off, man.</p>
<p class="full-script">I want to. Believe me. I have zero interest in your s*x life.</p>
<p class="full-script">But one thing that occurs to me...</p>
<p class="full-script">A room like this would have security cameras in it, yeah?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">But surely, you wouldn't knowingly record yourself making love on the boss' carpet.</p>
<p class="full-script">You'd have to know that the cameras in the room were off, Probably because you turned them off, being the head of security.</p>
<p class="full-script">They are off, aren't they, frank?</p>
<p class="full-script">So the question now is, frank, how long have they been off, And who else might have known they were gonna be off last night?</p>
<p class="full-script">You guys can take it from here. I am starving.</p>
<p class="full-script">Gotta get me some eggs.</p>
<p class="full-script">Garrity's, right?</p>
<p class="full-script">Thanks.</p>
<p class="full-script">You ready to tell us the truth?</p>
<p class="full-script">The Mentalist<br />
Season 01 Episode 13<br />
Paint It Red</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, look at this.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's known as &quot;the moro,&quot; from 14th century Italy.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's a portrait of somebody named carlotta moro.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's the only known works of an artist known as the &quot;siennese master.&quot;</p>
<p class="full-script">It's been owned by two popes, the king of france and john jacob astor, among others.</p>
<p class="full-script">But A.P. Caid bought it for $50 million 3 months ago.</p>
<p class="full-script">What do we know about Caid?</p>
<p class="full-script">Apart from he's an idiot with his money?</p>
<p class="full-script">Like the cover says, he got his start as a roughneck in the oil fields Then turned into a wildcatter and made a fortune by the time he was 30.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's a tough guy.</p>
<p class="full-script">His trick's pulling oil out of places nobody else has the balls to go.</p>
<p class="full-script">Where is he now?</p>
<p class="full-script">He's somewhere on a sailboat. He's been told what's going on.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's coming back as quick as he can.</p>
<p class="full-script">I was thinking, it would have been easy for him to sail up or down the coast a few miles, Put into a small marina and come back and commit the crime without anybody else knowing.</p>
<p class="full-script">And why would he want to do that?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm just saying he could.</p>
<p class="full-script">Maybe he wants the insurance money or he wants to get rid of Harry.</p>
<p class="full-script">Doesn't like that he's married to his daughter.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did you check with caid's security team?</p>
<p class="full-script">Everybody at the company that didn't wear a suit knew all about Frank Schiappa And his use of A.P.'s office.</p>
<p class="full-script">Any number of people might have known the cameras were off last night.</p>
<p class="full-script">Sounds like we're gonna have to check out any number of people.</p>
<p class="full-script">Where's Jane?</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't know.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, find him.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm gonna go and talk to Lashley's wife.</p>
<p class="full-script">You guys give caid's personnel files a good hard look.</p>
<p class="full-script">See if there's any criminal connections, especially Harry Lashley.</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you think he's dirty?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, he's involved.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why else would he be there in the middle of the night?</p>
<p class="full-script">It doesn't feel real.</p>
<p class="full-script">If it wasn't for you people, I wouldn't believe it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Harry's going to walk through the door, and this is all just a strange dream.</p>
<p class="full-script">But here you are. Harry's dead.</p>
<p class="full-script">When was the last time you spoke to him?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p class="full-script">Just chitchat, where to go for dinner.</p>
<p class="full-script">Then he left me a message canceling, didn't say why.</p>
<p class="full-script">That wasn't unusual, canceling without giving any reason?</p>
<p class="full-script">No. Harry was very hardworking, very keen.</p>
<p class="full-script">Stuff would come up all the time.</p>
<p class="full-script">What was his job here exactly?</p>
<p class="full-script">Good question.</p>
<p class="full-script">He was a sort of Jack-of-all-trades for my father, Did whatever he needed from week to week.</p>
<p class="full-script">My father liked having someone on hand with no ties or friendships within the company.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's a tough assignment.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">But he only joined the company when we were married.</p>
<p class="full-script">He was... Learning the ropes.</p>
<p class="full-script">Your father didn't want Harry to have a soft ride just 'cause he was your husband.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, you could put it like that.</p>
<p class="full-script">What was his previous employment?</p>
<p class="full-script">He was a musician. Jazz guitarist.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes. How did you know that?</p>
<p class="full-script">I looked at his fingers... Guitarist fingers.</p>
<p class="full-script">Jazz with a flamenco edge, judging by the ridge on his thumb.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">He was playing a gig at one of these ghastly, uh, events you have to go to, And you struck up a conversation.</p>
<p class="full-script">You love jazz, so you could talk with him easily, which, uh, normally, Is quite difficult for you out side of business.</p>
<p class="full-script">I... W... Yes. That's... But...</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm sorry, Miss Caid. He's just showing off.</p>
<p class="full-script">C-can you think of any reason why Harry would have been on this floor at that time of night?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, he would have known that neither I nor my father were here.</p>
<p class="full-script">So?</p>
<p class="full-script">I understand from my understand from my assistant That Frank Schiappa's misbehavior was an open secret amongst the junior staff.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's no longer a caid employee, by the way.</p>
<p class="full-script">Perhaps Harry had found out, and he was trying to catch him.</p>
<p class="full-script">Perhaps.</p>
<p class="full-script">Or is it possible that he had prior knowledge that the theft was gonna take place?</p>
<p class="full-script">You're asking if he could have been complicit in the theft?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="full-script">No. He was honest and gentle. No.</p>
<p class="full-script">So he never talked to you about the painting?</p>
<p class="full-script">No. I didn't approve of buying it.</p>
<p class="full-script">$50 million is far too much money to spend on a single object.</p>
<p class="full-script">When it comes to art, rational arguments don't apply for him.</p>
<p class="full-script">That would be Kathryn Hawkes' area of expertise.</p>
<p class="full-script">Kathryn Hawkes? She is...</p>
<p class="full-script">She buys the art for my father's collection.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's a terrible tragedy. Terrible.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did you know Mr. Lashley?</p>
<p class="full-script">Not well. I mean, I knew of him, obviously, but, uh, the poor man. It's very sad.</p>
<p class="full-script">But you think the loss of the painting is the real tragedy here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, no. Every human life is a sacred thing.</p>
<p class="full-script">But &quot;the moro&quot; is a uniquely beautiful treasure, beyond precious.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know the art market.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who would be willing and able to steal such a high-end piece?</p>
<p class="full-script">Worldwide, there's probably a good hundred collectors with the resources And passion enough to do something like this, But it's public knowledge that Mr. Caid outbid shirali Arlov to get the &quot;the moro.&quot;</p>
<p class="full-script">Mr. Arlov is not pleased.</p>
<p class="full-script">Shirali Arlov... The russian oil baron?</p>
<p class="full-script">Him.</p>
<p class="full-script">Arlov is a nasty piece of work.</p>
<p class="full-script">He has a legit front as an oilman, but he's a super rich gangster, basically.</p>
<p class="full-script">They say he likes his business rivals to be delivered to him hog-tied And naked so he can kill 'em personally.</p>
<p class="full-script">Vicious, reedy and the owner of the finest collection of renaissance paintings in russia.</p>
<p class="full-script">Sounds likes our kinda guy.</p>
<p class="full-script">Talk to the organized crime boys upstairs.</p>
<p class="full-script">Find out who Arlov's connections are in California, Who he'd use for a job like this and where they were last night.</p>
<p class="full-script">You got it, boss.</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you have?</p>
<p class="full-script">Harry Lashley has a past.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ten years ago in canada, he stole cash from a video store he was working at.</p>
<p class="full-script">Busted and served six months.</p>
<p class="full-script">Damn. I was hoping he was clean.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, I know.</p>
<p class="full-script">Then I tried to find any connection he had to the art world, and this popped up.</p>
<p class="full-script">A month ago, he paid a company called r.w.arts $20,000.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's pretty much the only financial transaction he's made recently.</p>
<p class="full-script">What's r.w.arts?</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't know yet. Shell, probably.</p>
<p class="full-script">The address is just a mailbox in lockesdale, a little farming town up north.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's interesting. Uh, let's Van Pelt and I go up and take a look-see.</p>
<p class="full-script">You and Van Pelt?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, she's from a small farming town. Aren't you?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="full-script">Right. Well, that's what you guys call, uh, what is it? Cover.</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you need cover for? You're a CBI operative.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, I thought I was a &quot;consultant.&quot;</p>
<p class="full-script">Just follow procedure. Have fun.</p>
<p class="full-script">Where's the fun in that? Shall we?</p>
<p class="full-script">How cute is this?</p>
<p class="full-script">It sure doesn't look like the lair of high-end art thieves.</p>
<p class="full-script">Not at all. Flowers and fruit...</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot;Rob Wallace gallery and framing.&quot;</p>
<p class="full-script">Bingo.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, let's not start with the badge.</p>
<p class="full-script">Let's get the lay of the land first, then we use the badge if we have to.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, okay.</p>
<p class="full-script">But don't embarrass me.</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="full-script">You know what I mean.</p>
<p class="full-script">No. What do you mean?</p>
<p class="full-script">Morning, folks.</p>
<p class="full-script">Look around, make yourself at home.</p>
<p class="full-script">Will do.</p>
<p class="full-script">I know what you're thinking.</p>
<p class="full-script">You do?</p>
<p class="full-script">You're thinking my fiancé is a lot younger than me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, no.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, she is.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll let you in on a little secret.</p>
<p class="full-script">I was her college professor, seduced her.</p>
<p class="full-script">No kidding.</p>
<p class="full-script">Her parents hated it. A lot of drama.</p>
<p class="full-script">Totally worth it, though. Right, babe?</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, that's what I mean. Come on. Stop it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, that's good. He's good.</p>
<p class="full-script">Do you think you could do a portrait of my fiancée?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, you bet.</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who's the boss in this relationship?</p>
<p class="full-script">He's just playing the fool. Stop it now.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, turn just a little to your left. There. Good.</p>
<p class="full-script">Looks good.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, just... Just make sure you don't do her eyes too close together.</p>

<p class="full-script">Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?</p>
<p class="full-script">That depends, I suppose.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, uh, go ahead.</p>
<p class="full-script">How lo have you and Patrick been together?</p>
<p class="full-script">Um, not long.</p>
<p class="full-script">Okay, I'm just gonna say it.</p>

<p class="full-script">Don't worry about that. Not gonna happen.</p>

<p class="full-script">Just, uh, that's great. Hold that, okay?</p>
<p class="full-script">Look down. Hold that.</p>
<p class="full-script">This way, I'm gonna have a lot of light on your cheekbones.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're gonna be so amazed with how good this looks...</p>

<p class="full-script">♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪</p>
<p class="full-script">Mr. Wallace, if you'd just let me show you my badge, 'Re from the California bureau of investigation.</p>
<p class="full-script">Our office knows we're here.</p>
<p class="full-script">If you kill us, they'll know who did it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Kill you? Why would I want to kill you?</p>
<p class="full-script">You're cops?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, she...</p>
<p class="full-script">We're investigating the murder of Harry Lashley.</p>
<p class="full-script">Lashley's dead?</p>
<p class="full-script">What happened? I...</p>
<p class="full-script">We were hoping you might be able to tell us that, considering you have the stolen painting.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, no, that's... That's a copy.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mr. Wallace here is a-an art forger, a very...Very good one, by the way.</p>
<p class="full-script">Um, that's a copy. He's not a thief.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, give me the shotgun.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mr. Lashley came to me a couple of months ago and commissioned two copies of &quot;the moro.&quot;</p>
<p class="full-script">How did he find you?</p>
<p class="full-script">People who need my services tend to find me eventually.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's not a crime, what I do.</p>
<p class="full-script">If you have a valuable painting, it's only sensible to have a copy made for the display, So that way, the real thing's safe.</p>
<p class="full-script">He picked up the copies about a month ago.</p>
<p class="full-script">So you gave him two copies already?</p>
<p class="full-script">What's this one for?</p>
<p class="full-script">This one I did for myself.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's a beautiful picture.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'd come to love her.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why did he want two copies?</p>
<p class="full-script">He didn't say.</p>
<p class="full-script">And you didn't ask questions.</p>
<p class="full-script">He paid me $10,000 for each of them, so no, I didn't ask any questions.</p>
<p class="full-script">How do we know this isn't the real thing?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not a forger. I'm an artist.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm not trying to trick anyone. Okay?</p>
<p class="full-script">I always added detail that ensures that nobody can sell my work as the genuine article.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's very ethical of you.</p>
<p class="full-script">It looks pretty much exactly the same to me.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, he's telling the truth. Take a closer look.</p>
<p class="full-script">What am I looking for?</p>
<p class="full-script">Closer.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, I still don't...</p>
<p class="full-script">You're getting warmer.</p>
<p class="full-script">A TV aerial.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">They didn't have TV.</p>
<p class="full-script">No. Beautiful work.</p>
<p class="full-script">May I borrow it for a while?</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, I don't know about that. How... How do I know I'm gonna get it back?</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, let me put it another way.</p>
<p class="full-script">Lend it to me or agent Van Pelt here will take you and the painting back to Sacramento and keep you there and ask you mind-numbing questions for hours and hours on end.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Copies, huh? Clever.</p>
<p class="full-script">Harry and his accomplices steal the painting once, but they get to sell it three times.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hey, boss. A.P. Caid's back from his trip.</p>
<p class="full-script">He's on his way back to his office.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, no, no. You got it all wrong.</p>
<p class="full-script">See, I told Harry to get a copy made on the hush-hush.</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, what kind of idiot is gonna put $50 million on his wall so anybody can steal it? Huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">So the painting that was stolen is a fake?</p>
<p class="full-script">Damn right, it was.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now the real one is in my... Private vault.</p>
<p class="full-script">With all due respect, A.P., the art here is my responsibility.</p>
<p class="full-script">Kathryn , the fewer people who knew, the better.</p>
<p class="full-script">Besides, it paid off, didn't it, huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">I mean, right now there's some thieving son of a bitch out there Who spent a whole lot of money on junk.</p>
<p class="full-script">Daddy, Harry's dead.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, baby, I know. I'm sorry. I know.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's too sad, but, uh, you know, I did like that kid.</p>
<p class="full-script">Can we see the painting?</p>
<p class="full-script">You want to see my baby?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll open the vault.</p>
<p class="full-script">Ain't she a beauty?</p>
<p class="full-script">You, uh, mind if I take a closer look?</p>
<p class="full-script">No. Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p class="full-script">A masterpiece of quattrocento portraiture, one of a kind.</p>
<p class="full-script">$50 million right there.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's about $10,000 right there. It's a fake.</p>
<p class="full-script">The hell it is.</p>
<p class="full-script">Fake as a $6 bill.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's not funny, son.</p>
<p class="full-script">Take a look back here by the trees, the guys on horseback.</p>
<p class="full-script">The third one in from the left, next to the footmen...</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see the horses. What...</p>
<p class="full-script">What do you think, is that an m16 or a kalashnikov?</p>
<p class="full-script">Son of a bitch.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, I think it's a kalashnikov.</p>
<p class="full-script">Son of a bitch. There's...</p>
<p class="full-script">There's a machine gun in my painting. How in the hell could you not notice that?</p>
<p class="full-script">If this bozo here can see it, why couldn't you?</p>
<p class="full-script">A.P., I can assure you, the painting...</p>
<p class="full-script">No, no, no, no.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're the one who has the good eye.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, you brought me a fake.</p>
<p class="full-script">Mr. Caid, I can state with absolute certainty the painting Which I purchased for you and placed in your hands was genuine.</p>
<p class="full-script">I have the documents to prove it.</p>
<p class="full-script">If you chose to engage in some clever subterfuge without my knowledge, I can hardly be blamed for the results.</p>
<p class="full-script">Excuse me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Harry. That son of a bitch Harry...</p>
<p class="full-script">He switched out the real painting for the fake one.</p>
<p class="full-script">And then bludgeoned himself to death, I suppose? You have no basis for that.</p>
<p class="full-script">That was probably one of his crackhead musician friends he brought along.</p>
<p class="full-script">You don't know that. That's not fair.</p>
<p class="full-script">Were you aware he spent time in prison?</p>
<p class="full-script">6 months for theft in canada,10 years ago.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes. I mean, no, I didn't.</p>
<p class="full-script">Um, i-i'm sure it doesn't...</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, I'm sure it's not...</p>
<p class="full-script">It was ten years ago.</p>
<p class="full-script">I knew it.</p>
<p class="full-script">I knew it. This guy was no good for you.</p>
<p class="full-script">I could feel it, but I kept quiet, didn't i?</p>
<p class="full-script">For your sake, I forced myself to trust this guy.</p>
<p class="full-script">Because you finally had yourself a man.</p>
<p class="full-script">He stole $50 million from me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Damn it, stevie.</p>
<p class="full-script">Please. I beg you. Find my husband's murderer.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's what we're trying to do, ma'am.</p>
<p class="full-script">They'll tell you the truth. I want the truth.</p>
<p class="full-script">You can go now.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's all we need at the moment. We'll be in touch.</p>
<p class="full-script">Right.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, I hate to be blunt, Mr. Caid, but you're just...</p>
<p class="full-script">Let's... Oh, no, you don't.</p>
<p class="full-script">We'll... We'll talk later.</p>
<p class="full-script">Harry has copies made, but he doesn't hang one on the wall to disguise the robbery. Why?</p>
<p class="full-script">Because it was part of the plan.</p>
<p class="full-script">Everyone has to know the painting was stolen for him to have anything to sell.</p>
<p class="full-script">The painting has to be missing.</p>
<p class="full-script">So he makes the switch, goes to steal the real painting off the wall, Knowing frisky Frank has turned the cameras off.</p>
<p class="full-script">So who kills him then?</p>
<p class="full-script">Whoever ended up delivering the painting to a buyer.</p>
<p class="full-script">Harry outlived his usefulness the minute he used his security pass to get into a. P. 'S office.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, we just heard from the organized crime boys about shirali Arlov.</p>
<p class="full-script">We did?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah.</p>
<p class="full-script">The good news is he's in California... L. A. He arrived a couple of days ago.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, that can't be a coincidence.</p>
<p class="full-script">All right, what's the bad news?</p>
<p class="full-script">The bad news is he's traveling on a diplomatic passport.</p>
<p class="full-script">We cannot touch him under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="full-script">If we could just ask him a couple questions...</p>
<p class="full-script">State department was crystal clear... Keep away.</p>
<p class="full-script">Arlov controls an oil pipeline route this country needs.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's a national security issue.</p>
<p class="full-script">Another argument for energy independence there.</p>
<p class="full-script">Where's he staying?</p>
<p class="full-script">I repeat, do not touch.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, no, no. No touching. I promise.</p>
<p class="full-script">Nope, nyet, no, and minelli says no, too. That's four nos.</p>
<p class="full-script">Minelli always says no. It's his job.</p>
<p class="full-script">And it's my job to listen to him.</p>
<p class="full-script">You'd walk away?</p>
<p class="full-script">If Arlov is our man, you'd let him get away with murder?</p>
<p class="full-script">He didn't do the murder.</p>
<p class="full-script">He probably bought the painting from the murderer.</p>
<p class="full-script">We'll never know unless we go talk to him.</p>
<p class="full-script">We're gonna close this case, but not by causing an international scandal.</p>
<p class="full-script">Arlov's the key.</p>
<p class="full-script">I want to get Harry Lashley's killer as much as you do, but we cannot go after Arlov.</p>
<p class="full-script">The state department...</p>
<p class="full-script">A fig to the state department.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, I agree. Screw 'em.</p>
<p class="full-script">That attitude is why I'm in charge and you guys aren't.</p>
<p class="full-script">And would you please leave some of those for everybody else?</p>
<p class="full-script">They're so small.</p>
<p class="full-script">I just don't understand why a law officer can't go after a known criminal.</p>
<p class="full-script">Damn right.</p>
<p class="full-script">If we left now, we could be in l.a.before dark.</p>
<p class="full-script">What?</p>
<p class="full-script">Tell cho to meet us in the parking lot in ten minutes.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hello?</p>
<p class="full-script">You ready?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you ready?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm ready. What's the signal?</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot;she is beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p class="full-script">Good.</p>
<p class="full-script">Let's do this.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, could you tell Mr. Arlov Patrick Jane is here?</p>
<p class="full-script">I have &quot;the moro&quot; portrait that was stolen a couple days ago.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'd like to sell it to him.</p>
<p class="full-script">What?</p>
<p class="full-script">Let him come in.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Good evening.</p>
<p class="full-script">Please sit.</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot;world's best collisions.&quot;</p>
<p class="full-script">You know this show?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, you should check it out. It's, uh, very amusing and, uh, educational.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's a lesson for us all.</p>
<p class="full-script">Anytime, anyplace, boom... Your life can be over.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's very true.</p>
<p class="full-script">Would you like a drink, a snack?</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, yes. Um, sparkling water. Please.</p>
<p class="full-script">No ice, room temperature.</p>
<p class="full-script">♪♪♪♪♪♪</p>
<p class="full-script">Where is everyone?</p>
<p class="full-script">Weird. They all called in to sign out.</p>
<p class="full-script">Jane wasn't feeling well, Rigsby's got a hot date, and cho got kings tickets.</p>
<p class="full-script">Son of a...</p>
<p class="full-script">What?</p>
<p class="full-script">Jane doesn't get sick, Rigsby's not on a date because he's in love with you, And the kings aren't playing tonight.</p>
<p class="full-script">You know about that?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yeah, they're on an east coast road trip.</p>
<p class="full-script">They're playing the knicks tomorrow night.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, I mean, about Rigsby... How do you know about that?</p>
<p class="full-script">Everybody knows that. The attorney general knows that.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm so embarrassed.</p>
<p class="full-script">Please.</p>
<p class="full-script">Pick up the phone, damn it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">So...</p>
<p class="full-script">Mr. Patrick Jane.</p>
<p class="full-script">You have a painting you want to sell me?</p>
<p class="full-script">&quot;the carlotta moro&quot;?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes.</p>
<p class="full-script">I don't believe you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Would you like to take a look?</p>
<p class="full-script">Sure.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you mad?</p>
<p class="full-script">No, I'm just kidding. Kidding.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's just a prop to get me into the room.</p>
<p class="full-script">I am aware that you have the real painting.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, really? You are aware?</p>
<p class="full-script">And how are you aware of this?</p>
<p class="full-script">A guess, confirmed by a predatory smile on your face When you asked me about it just then.</p>
<p class="full-script">You enjoy trapping people in nets of their own making, don't you?</p>
<p class="full-script">That's... That's, um, that's very perceptive of you.</p>
<p class="full-script">Not really.</p>
<p class="full-script">Most successful criminal bosses share a similar profile...</p>
<p class="full-script">Sadistic, violent, but also highly methodical and psychologically astute.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why are you here, Mr. Jane?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm a detective of sorts.</p>
<p class="full-script">Explain.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm trying to find out who killed Harry Lashley.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who?</p>
<p class="full-script">The man who died in the course of the painting's theft.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, yes, yes, I recall. Poor fellow.</p>
<p class="full-script">If you're looking for a bribe, I'm afraid, um, you're running out of luck.</p>
<p class="full-script">You see, uh, you do understand that I have immunity from prosecution in this country?</p>
<p class="full-script">I know, I know. No touching.</p>
<p class="full-script">I show you my identification to discourage you from killing me or torturing me or something.</p>
<p class="full-script">You might not get arrested for it, but you sure will make some kind of a fuss.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, I don't mind fuss, you know?</p>
<p class="full-script">Anything to avoid boredom.</p>
<p class="full-script">Given your immunity, you could tell me who you bought the painting from and do no harm to yourself.</p>
<p class="full-script">And inform to the police? Why?</p>
<p class="full-script">Why on earth would I do that?</p>
<p class="full-script">Harry Lashley didn't deserve to die.</p>
<p class="full-script">He has a wife who needs to know what happened. She deserves justice.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you serious? &quot;she deserves justice,&quot; huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">Perhaps you haven't paid the full price for the painting yet.</p>
<p class="full-script">Perhaps an arrest would save you some... Money.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, well, that's... That's not a bad thought.</p>
<p class="full-script">But you see, i-i love my art collection.</p>
<p class="full-script">I-i love beauty.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's why I do what I do, you know?</p>
<p class="full-script">Who would want to sell to me if I start sending my suppliers to jail, you know?</p>
<p class="full-script">True. Well, I thought it was worth a try.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you, and I'm sorry for wasting your time.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, no, no, no. Not at all. Not at all.</p>
<p class="full-script">You are a very... Very strange kind of policeman.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's been most diverting.</p>
<p class="full-script">Could I see it before I leave... The moro?</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm told it's very beautiful.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, you... You appreciate art, huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">Why not? Of course.</p>
<p class="full-script">What's happening?</p>
<p class="full-script">Soon. Get ready.</p>
<p class="full-script">Here you go. Look at that. It's a... An italian silk merchant's wife.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's 600 years old. It's... And it's alive.</p>
<p class="full-script">It's... It's immortal.</p>
<p class="full-script">May I?</p>
<p class="full-script">Please. Please.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now I understand why you went to such lengths to get her.</p>
<p class="full-script">She is beautiful.</p>
<p class="full-script">Now.</p>
<p class="full-script">Everybody out. Out. Out. Out.</p>
<p class="full-script">Please, out. Out. Out!</p>
<p class="full-script">Out!</p>
<p class="full-script">Well? Well?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes!</p>
<p class="full-script">You better call lisbon, give her an update.</p>
<p class="full-script">You call her.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, I can't. I'm driving. Cho?</p>
<p class="full-script">No way.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, come on, guys. I just robbed a russian mobster. You can't call lisbon?</p>
<p class="full-script">You gonna be grumpy like this in the room?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm just asking. I don't think it's very professional.</p>
<p class="full-script">Seriously, don't push me.</p>
<p class="full-script">I said I was sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">You had express orders to stay away from Arlov.</p>
<p class="full-script">But that's why I didn't tell you. You have total deniability.</p>
<p class="full-script">But that's beside the point.</p>
<p class="full-script">The point is, my brilliant plan worked like clockwork.</p>
<p class="full-script">What plan? This case is not closed. You haven't done anything yet.</p>
<p class="full-script">Not yet, but you watch.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, I disagree.</p>
<p class="full-script">Morning!</p>
<p class="full-script">I'll get back to you.</p>
<p class="full-script">What the hell?</p>
<p class="full-script">You got it back. Ing her to me.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, baby!</p>
<p class="full-script">This is fabulous. Was it Arlov? Did he have it?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, it was.</p>
<p class="full-script">How did you get it back?</p>
<p class="full-script">I stole it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Are you serious?</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, there was nothing we could do legally, as you said.</p>
<p class="full-script">But Arlov was in possession of a stolen painting.</p>
<p class="full-script">So there was nothing he could do either.</p>
<p class="full-script">This gets better and better.</p>
<p class="full-script">First of all, I get the painting back.</p>
<p class="full-script">Second, when Arlov finds out that I've got it, it'll kill him.</p>
<p class="full-script">Who cares about Arlov?</p>
<p class="full-script">Who cares about the damn painting?</p>
<p class="full-script">You assured me you would find Harry's killer.</p>
<p class="full-script">We're doing everything we can, stevie, but there's not a lot left for us to do.</p>
<p class="full-script">Look, stevie, I know you loved him.</p>
<p class="full-script">And I liked him, too, but he was part of this theft.</p>
<p class="full-script">He betrayed me.</p>
<p class="full-script">In a way, this is a good thing that he's gone, Because you could be having children with this bum right now. All right?</p>
<p class="full-script">You think of that. We dodged a bullet here.</p>
<p class="full-script">Come on, give me a hug.</p>
<p class="full-script">Look, we're gonna find you a good man.</p>
<p class="full-script">The main thing is we sent out a message here that nobody messes with A.P. Caid.</p>
<p class="full-script">Thank you, thank you.</p>
<p class="full-script">I had a daughter once.</p>
<p class="full-script">She died. Killed. It was my fault.</p>
<p class="full-script">That's how I know that a man who treats his only daughter the way you do is a fool.</p>
<p class="full-script">Jane.</p>
<p class="full-script">What did you say?</p>
<p class="full-script">Your child is hurting, and you're crowing over this petty victory like a cockerel on a dung heap.</p>
<p class="full-script">You're a blind, vain, emotionally stunted fool.</p>
<p class="full-script">You care more about this...</p>
<p class="full-script">For this painting, for all this rubbish...</p>
<p class="full-script">Than you do the child that loves you.</p>
<p class="full-script">You found my painting. I am grateful.</p>
<p class="full-script">And now I'm going to be patient and tell you, you get this clown out of my office...</p>
<p class="full-script">How am I gonna make you understand?</p>
<p class="full-script">Right now.</p>
<p class="full-script">How am I gonna make you understand? See this?</p>
<p class="full-script">Jane... See this?</p>
<p class="full-script">This is nothing. It's nothing.</p>
<p class="full-script">What are you doing?</p>
<p class="full-script">Jane!</p>
<p class="full-script">Don't!</p>
<p class="full-script">What are you, nuts?</p>
<p class="full-script">Jane? Jane, have you gone crazy?</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, no, no. I'm just doing my job. Look.</p>
<p class="full-script">You'd think that someone that has dedicated their lives to fine art would want to save a masterpiece from burning up. Wouldn't you?</p>
<p class="full-script">Unless she already knew it was just another fake.</p>
<p class="full-script">No, not at all. I'm just... I'm just shocked, that's all.</p>
<p class="full-script">Is it a fake?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, it is.</p>
<p class="full-script">I only found out after I stole it, but Kathryn knew, because it was she who stole the original, And it is she who still has it in her safe possession.</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Is that true, kathryn?</p>
<p class="full-script">No.</p>
<p class="full-script">Horrible job you found for yourself, kathryn...</p>
<p class="full-script">Helping a greedy egotist snatch up beautiful things he has no ability to appreciate.</p>
<p class="full-script">And you don't get paid much, do you?</p>
<p class="full-script">All the money, beauty around you, and you can't have any of it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Very frustrating.</p>
<p class="full-script">Not at all.</p>
<p class="full-script">Harry came to you for advice about the painting.</p>
<p class="full-script">You asked him to make a second copy for your own personal use.</p>
<p class="full-script">Did you blackmail him? Huh?</p>
<p class="full-script">Must've known about the theft conviction in canada, threatened to tell A.P.</p>
<p class="full-script">And destroy the life he was building with stevie.</p>
<p class="full-script">Care to comment on that?</p>
<p class="full-script">It's all nonsense, A.P. It's nonsense.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, is it? The reason you had two copies made...</p>
<p class="full-script">So that you could sell one to Arlov, and you could keep the original picture for yourself because, Of course, you're the only one that really deserves it.</p>
<p class="full-script">It was her? She did it?</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes. Like I switched the paintings with Arlov, She switched the original with Harry sss right before it went into the vault.</p>
<p class="full-script">All you had to do was come up in here after hours and take it off the wall.</p>
<p class="full-script">But Harry suspected something, didn't he?</p>
<p class="full-script">He tried to stop you...</p>
<p class="full-script">And you killed him.</p>
<p class="full-script">Tell the truth, kathryn. Our people are g||ng through your apartment right now.</p>
<p class="full-script">They will find that painting even if they have to tear the place to the ground.</p>
<p class="full-script">There is no point in lying anymore.</p>
<p class="full-script">I'm sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">I never meant to kill him.</p>
<p class="full-script">Why did he try to stop me?</p>
<p class="full-script">No!</p>
<p class="full-script">No, no, baby. No, baby, don't.</p>
<p class="full-script">It was an accident.</p>
<p class="full-script">Kathryn , you're under arrest for the murder of Harry Lashley.</p>
<p class="full-script">Put your hands behind your back.</p>
<p class="full-script">Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.</p>
<p class="full-script">It was a mistake.</p>
<p class="full-script">Come on. Let's go.</p>
<p class="full-script">Uh, for what it's worth, I, uh, I just wanted to apologize for my pious rant earlier.</p>
<p class="full-script">I needed a pretext to burn the picture, and...</p>
<p class="full-script">Your family dysfunction became it.</p>
<p class="full-script">Well, no, sir. No apology needed.</p>
<p class="full-script">There was some good, hard truth in what you said.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yes, there was, but you know, no one likes to be too judgmental.</p>
<p class="full-script">Hard to believe it's a fake.</p>
<p class="full-script">Crazy, isn't it?</p>
<p class="full-script">One painting's worth $50 million, the other's only worth a few thousand.</p>
<p class="full-script">They look identical.</p>
<p class="full-script">Yep. Crazy.</p>
<p class="full-script">Not that you mention it, I'm not sure, uh...</p>
<p class="full-script">Ah, it's so hard to solve after work.</p>
